# Scott Willsey

This is version 4.0.0 of my website, [scottwillsey.com](https://scottwillsey.com). This version is to bring compatibility with [Astro](https://astro.build) 4.x., as well as add some other quality of life and visual improvements.

Astro is the fastest web development framework I've ever used, primarily because it's so well thought out and so easy to understand and write for.
