# Scott Willsey

This is version 3.0 of my website, [scottwillsey.com](https://scottwillsey.com). This version is to bring compatibility with [Astro](https://astro.build) 3.x.

In theory, just migrating the existing repo should have worked, but I couldn't get Images from astro:assets to work and I could if I started from scratch and pulled code and content back in, so that's what I did.

Astro is the fastest web development framework I've ever used, primarily because it's so well thought out and so easy to understand and write for.
