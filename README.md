# Scott Willsey

This is version 6.0.0 of my website, [scottwillsey.com](https://scottwillsey.com). This version is a UI refresh, a (mostly) switch to Tailwind CSS, and some other little utilities and additions.

Recently I've added some pages inspired by fun trends on the web: a [now](https://scottwillsey.com/now/) page, a [links](https://scottwillsey.com/links/) page, a [uses](https://scottwillsey.com/uses/) page.

Astro is the fastest web development framework I've ever used, primarily because it's so well thought out and so easy to understand and write for.

- [Astro Content Loader API](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/content-loader-reference/) for content collections.
- [Filtering Content Collection Queries](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#filtering-collection-queries) to let me filter out drafts from being built to production accidentally.
