# Scott Willsey

This is version 5.1.0 of my website, [scottwillsey.com](https://scottwillsey.com). This version is to bring compatibility with [Astro](https://astro.build) 5.x., as well as add some other quality of life and visual improvements.

Recently I've added some pages inspired by fun trends on the web: a [now](https://scottwillsey.com/now/) page, a [links](https://scottwillsey.com/links/) page, a [uses](https://scottwillsey.com/uses/) page.

Astro is the fastest web development framework I've ever used, primarily because it's so well thought out and so easy to understand and write for.
