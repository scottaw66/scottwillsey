  "Title": "Taking an Internet Walk – Syllabus",
  "Description": "The Internet is so much vaster than a single worldview. Instead of traversing the congested highways of the web, we invite you to try alternative routes: take a scroll down local streets and wandering paths, try out someone else’s commute, rediscover the favorites of your neighborhood, and gather the friends you love in your favorite spots, quiet and comforting.",
