  "Description": "Cryptocurrency companies have raised hundreds of millions of dollars to put towards buying crypto-friendly politicians and ousting those who have spoken up for stricter regulations to protect consumers in an industry that is fraught with hacks, scams, and fraud. This website shines a much-needed spotlight on this spending, without the veneer of press releases in which these companies and executives still try to claim to be “apolitical” or “non-partisan”.",
