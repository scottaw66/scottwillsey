  "Description": "This website is a labor of love maintained by an Infocom fan and obssessive archivist who fondly remembers the first time he was eaten by a grue in the early 1980s. The site is dedicated to (1) archiving historical Infocom-related artifacts -- InvisiClues, of course, but also magazine articles, marketing material, packaging, artwork, literature, and the games themselves -- and (2) making the archives available in an enjoyable format.",
