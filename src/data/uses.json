Wow, built like a TANK, as [Jason](https://grepjason.sh) says. I love the feel of the switches, the sound, the weight, the look, the feel, the everything. I'm not sure I'll ever use another keyboard again. Also... come on. Look at those shades of blue. It *is* available in other colors, but why??",
