    "alttext": "Blade Runner 2049 • 2017 • Denis Villeneuve • One of my favorite movies ever. Ryan Gosling is perfect emotionally as a replicant who wants to be human, and is more human than most of the humans around him. • Loved ItTEST"

    "alttext": "The Fall Guy • 2024 • Yeah, I guess it's kind of dumb, but I really enjoyed it. Ryan Gosling is always good as a guy who has terrible things to do and he just gets on and does what has to be done. And Emily Blunt is always completely her character. Great actors, both. • Loved It!"
