    "alttext": "Dark Wire • Joseph Cox • Joseph Cox is a great security beat journalist, and this story is wild enough already. Sometimes I think the FBI just does stuff because they can and can secretly have fun doing it. • Loved It!"

    "alttext": "The Ministry for the Future • Kim Stanley Robinson • I enjoyed this book when I read it, because they captured the climate change disaster headed our way. What they didn't foresee, however, is just how insane governments all over the world would go before we even get that far. Not dystopian enough after all. • Liked It"

    "alttext": "Snow Crash • Neal Stephenson • 1992  • This has to be one of the classic cyberpunk novels. It's dumb AND cool, silly AND serious. It's also a fascinating look at how language controls thought and vice-versa. • Loved It!"
