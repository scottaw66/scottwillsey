    <p>
      This site has lots of <a href="/links">/links</a> and my <a href="/uses"
        >/uses</a
      >, <a href="/reviews">reviews</a>, and <a href="/now">/now</a> pages.
    </p>

      I spent my formative years living in <a
        href="https://www.kagoshima-yokanavi.jp/en"
        >Kagoshima City
      </a>, Japan, a rare gaijin at that time and place. <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakurajima"
        >Sakurajima
      </a> dumped ash on us regularly, proving that its reputation as one of the world’s
      most active volcanoes is no lie, and earthquakes and typhoons were part of the
      package.
    </p>

    <p>
      For me, there was no better place to spend my youth. I learned another
      language, and more importantly, another way of thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      My interest in computing technology was born in Japan as well. My brother
      scrounged parts off an IBM employee he was friends with and built homebrew
      systems that he programmed in binary and hex. We played with Japanese
      computers and the <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/appleii.html"
        >Apple II
      </a>. I learned to type thanks to game code listings in magazines like <a
        href="http://www.softalkapple.com/"
        >Softalk
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first personally owned computer was the original
      <a href="https://www.apple-history.com/128k">128k Macintosh</a> which my dad
      bought for me. Today I’m still a Mac user, but I also spent a lot of years on
      PCs and I still use them at work.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is for me to talk about automation and geekiness for Mac and the
      web – Shortcuts, apps, secret terminal incantations, Astro, Maudit, CSS,
      and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've done a few podcasts over the years, none of which were wildly
      successful, but I keep doing them anyway. Currently I host <a
        href="https://friendswithbrews.com">Friends with Brews podcast</a
      > with my amazing friend <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@nikolaidis"
        >Peter Nikolaidis</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      My happiness in life is due to my wife and daughter. They are amazing. And
      also due to my cats, even though they refuse to love each other.
