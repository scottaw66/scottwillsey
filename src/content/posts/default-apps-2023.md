Once upon a time,[^1] the [Hemispheric Views podcast](https://hemisphericviews.com) held the first ever Duel of the Defaults in which they decided who was the winner at using the most default apps for several categories. Subsequently, [Gabz posted his own default app list](https://gabz.blog/2023/11/03/my-defaults.html), and then [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me) took it to 11 with his [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me) page.

In the spirit of this new fashion of blogging about one's default apps, here are mine as of December, 2023.
