Not long ago, I created a [Links](/links) page which I used to hold links I wanted to keep temporarily, like a little pinboard. But then I realized “HEY!! THIS IS BAD!!” People expect a links page to be things like blogrolls and stuff they might like, not the stupid stuff Scott Willsey wants to remember for a day or month or year or three.

So as of today, I now have [Links](/links), which is what people expect of a links page, and [Pins](/pins), which is what I apparently expect of a links page.

[Links](/links) is now, just to clarify, a permanent-ish list of links to things that YOU, the reader, might also find interesting.

[Pins](/pins) is, just to also clarify, where I’ll stick ephemeral stuff that I want to get back to but doesn’t make sense to stick in a read later app.
