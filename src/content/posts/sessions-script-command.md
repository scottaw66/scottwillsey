I've written a bunch of words on this site about programming stuff in [Astro](https://astro.build), but there are bunches of other things that can be scripted too. Literal Bunches in fact â€“ enter [Bunch](https://bunchapp.co), a Mac automation app for launching apps and running commands with just a click. It's written by [Brett Terpstra](https://brettterpstra.com), which is a name any Mac automation geek will know.
