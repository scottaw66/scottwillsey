You may have noticed that the site menu has a couple new icons in it. One looks like a timer or stopwatch – that’s a link to the [/now](/now) page, which I’ve had for awhile, but haven’t had a menu link to. The other looks like movie director clapper with a gear on it – that’s a link to a new page: my [/reviews](/reviews) page.

You may look at both the [/now](/now) page and the [/reviews](/reviews) page and think “yeah, but they’ve both got these little reviews on them”, and that’s true, but there is a difference. The /now page reviews are the latest only, and some of them (TV series and books, for example) may be things still in progress. These are ephemeral – they’ll drop off as I move on to new stuff.

The reviews page is only items I’ve finished, and is ALL of the items I’ve finished that I’ve written reviews for. Nothing will drop off here. Eventually, then, I’ll probably need to break each category (Movies, TV Series, Books, Games) off into their own pages so it doesn’t take an hour and a half to load the page. 45 minutes I could live with, 90 minutes not so much.

I’m working on an article with an accompanying video about my workflow for creating and publishing these reviews. I think you’ll find it interesting to see how much of the process I’ve managed to automate.
