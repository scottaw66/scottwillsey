Did you know my [Links](/links) page has an ever-changing Cool Site Spotlight? I’ve mentioned it tangentially before, but I want to mention both it and my Links page specifically now because I think both are pretty cool.

I started my Links page in January of 2024 with the intention of making it a blogroll, but it’s much more than that now. For one thing, right at the top is a Cool Site Spotlight highlighting one site I’ve stumbled across that I think is unusually neat. I rotate entries out into the [Cool Sites Archive section of the Links page](/links#cool-sites-archive) as I highlight a new one.

Not only does this keep me interested and looking around me, it should serve as a good idea and interest generator for my readers too.

If the web is ever going to be cool again, this is how it starts: finding and linking to things that make it a better place.
