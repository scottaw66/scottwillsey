I don't remember how I stumbled across the [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) movement started by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), but I immediately thought "what a great idea!" and decided to add one to my site.

The concept is simple â€“ it's a page that lists some current interests, activities, or projects that you're into or doing. I decided to title mine "[Current and Recent Things](https://scottwillsey.com/now/)" because it seemed more appropriate when talking about food I've recently enjoyed or movies I've recently watched to label those as "recent" instead of "right this second".

This is the kind of thing I like about personal websites. I think I a lot of people are realizing that blogging isn't dead yet, it's not even [just resting](https://genius.com/Monty-python-parrot-oh-not-again-annotated), and additions to personal sites like now pages make personal blogs and websites even more fun to maintain.

You should try it, if you're not already.

Anyway... here it is. [My now page](/now).
