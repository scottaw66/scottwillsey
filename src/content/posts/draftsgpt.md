I love [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) for writing blog posts, podcast episode show notes, and more. I used to also use it for saving self-written tech-related documentation in, but now that is primarily in Obsidian. But Drafts is great for "writing writing". [Workspaces](https://actions.getdrafts.com/workspaces), [actions](https://actions.getdrafts.com/drafts_actions), [themes](https://actions.getdrafts.com/theme_definitions), [templates](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/), and huge amounts of built-in functionality make it a flexible, capable writing tool. It's also super keyboard shortcut friendly, which is a huge must-have for me.

And now it's even better, because it has everyone's favorite buzzword, [ChatGPT](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-openai-chatgpt-with-drafts/14221)!

This is actually a pretty cool feature, assuming you're experienced with ChatGPT and know its strengths and weaknesses and how to dig the truth out from its inevitable lies. I've [talked about MacGPT and its inline mode](https://scottwillsey.com/allgpts/) before, and using ChatGPT in Drafts is very much like using MacGPT's inline mode. It's very easy to create actions to define things, check spelling, summarize a selection, or to write code to match requirements specified in a prompt. In fact, Greg Pierce, creator of Drafts, has written [some actions to do those very things](https://actions.getdrafts.com/search?utf8=âœ“&q=GPT).[^1]

I made some quick short videos showing these actions in... well... action. Have a look. By the way, I modified the OpenAI: Translate Selection action to include Japanese as an option. As written, it included Spanish, French, German, English.
