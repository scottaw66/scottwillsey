Once upon a time,[^1] the [Hemispheric Views podcast](https://hemisphericviews.com) held the first ever [Duel of the Defaults](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) in which they decided who was the winner at using the most default apps for several categories. Then [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me) took it to 11 with his [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me) page.

In the continued spirit of blogging about one's default apps, here is my updated list for 2024.
