I’m not dead yet, [I’m just resting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SB4gB3DEhA)!  I took a couple weeks to tour Japan with my daughter and then a couple more weeks to get over whatever I caught at the end of our trip (I genuinely suspect it was the terrible throat variation of Covid going around. It wiped me out).

I have updates though!

## Spotlighting Tahoe

First of all, I installed the Tahoe developer beta on my Mac, and I immediately started playing with Apple’s updated Spotlight. If I had to bet money, I would never have put any down on being able to replace Raycast with it, but that’s exactly what I’ve done. I’ll have several posts on the hows and whys of this in the future.

## Photos with a Lightbox

I took many photos in Japan. Not nearly enough, as it turns out, but many. Before I left for Japan, I started whipping together an Astro site that I could post them to, imagining I’d live-post from Japan, but that didn’t happen. In fact, I just now have the site to a workable state I’m happy with. It’s at [Photos and Words](https://photos.scottwillsey.com/). I haven't started adding my Japan trip photos yet though – stay tuned!

I created a public GitHub repo ([scottaw66/astro-photoswipe: An Astro photo website with Photoswipe for the Lightbox functionality.](https://github.com/scottaw66/astro-photoswipe)) with the code so you can fork it and show me how much better of a programmer and designer than I am.

## Tailscale and Travel Routers

The combination of Tailscale and my [GL-AXT1800 / Slate AX - GL.iNet](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-axt1800/) travel router was a huge win for me in Japan. The travel router is nice – it can connect to any wifi source so I was able to get it on the hotel networks and then all our devices could just connect to it. Even better, it supports Tailscale so I could use an exit node that is allowed to SSH into servers I help manage and web apps I need for paid work.

## More to Come

Each of these probably deserves some coverage on its own, which is my plan. I’m really looking forward into coalescing my thoughts on Spotlight as a Raycast sherlocker, because I know many people will not believe it possible.
