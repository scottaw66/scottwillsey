My brother likes to send emails to dad and I containing links of interesting things heâ€™s read recently, replete with commentary of his own. I used to send one link at a time to them, then I tried his approach, and now I generally send a link at a time again.

Instead of this nonsense, I thought Iâ€™d create a [Weekly Reads page](https://scottwillsey.com/reads/1/) to add Weekly Reads posts to, complete with its own [RSS feed](https://scottwillsey.com/reads/rss.xml).

I may *call* it Weekly Reads,  but I may add reads more than weekly or much less than weekly. I donâ€™t know. Donâ€™t pressure me! I have a lot going on! ðŸ˜„

I need to create some links to it so people can find it and know it exists, but itâ€™s there! It works!
