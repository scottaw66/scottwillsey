I clearly need a change in 2026. It's obvious no one cares about any of the things I write here, which is fine. It's also clear that I don't care about a lot of them anymore either, which is also fine. So the question is, what should I write about on this blog that I **will** continue to care about and that other people might care about too?

I think 2026 is going to be the year of honesty. That doesn't mean I've been dishonest, far from it. It just means that I'm going to focus on things that actually matter to me on this site, in terms of technology, rather than coming up with topics that I think I should write about for some reason. Clear as mud, right?

This site has, in recent years, been solely focused on my use of technology, mainly Mac and web related. I doubt that's going to change much. I don't want to write about personal stuff or politics or Tonkatsu recipes here (even though writing about Tonkatsu recipes really is a winner in any situation). I think what I need to do is quit trying to write series about topics, like replacing Raycast with Spotlight, and write more one-offs. When I do write follow-up articles, I'll try to handle it differently than making big official series of articles.

In fact, I've quietly rid the site of lists of series and all post frontmatter referring to series. It's gone. I don't need it. YOU don't need it.

Maybe it'll turn out I still have nothing of interest to say, and you still don't care, and then I'll just quietly quit posting and no one will notice or care. I don't know. But mainly I think I need to figure out what I really enjoy writing about, in terms of technology,[^1] and do that.

Stay tuned... if you care to. 🙂
