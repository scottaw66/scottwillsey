## Current Personal Status
>
> I have been playing with Clawdbot/Moltbot/[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), and there are some fascinating things about it, and some utterly enraging things about it, and some quite dangerous things about it. I'm not a person that likes huge fanaticism around things, and it's definitely getting that. But there are some aspects of it that do seem like the future of AI agents.

## Current Projects

- Japanese and Korean study (somewhat proficient in J, complete newb to K)

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year Volume 2 • Jonathan Strahan • Mar 1, 2008 • This is a really good and varied compilation of stories. The thing these books do well is introduce you to stories and authors you wouldn't have found yourself, and that are certainly interesting and thought-proving. *****</span>

[<span hidden>The Convenience Store by the Sea • First Time Read • 2020 • Sonoko Machida • I didn't know what to think of this book initially. It felt slightly stilted, whether due to translation or not, I'm not sure. But I kept reading. And it started drawing me in by brilliantly building intertwined moments of social interactions and vignettes of character development. • Loved It!</span>

### Movies

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Shrinking • S3E1 • I still have mixed feelings about this show. Everyone is still snarky in the same way that big groups of friends/acquaintences actually aren't, and it does ruin the genuinely good overall story. ***</span>
