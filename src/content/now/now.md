### Podcasts

- [The Incomparable 700: A Dark Totoro](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/700/) *I always enjoy a good Miyazaki film discussion.*

***Recently Finished***

- [Upgrade #496: 40th Anniversary of the Mac Draft - Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/496) *If you love the Mac like I do and you've used it for as long as I have, this may be one of the best episodes of any podcast you've ever listned to.*

### Books

- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*
- [Endless Loop: The History of the BASIC Programming Language (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)](https://www.amazon.com/Endless-Loop-Programming-All-purpose-Instruction/dp/1974277070) *It's just fun.*

***Stuck in Progress***

- [The Confusion](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-confusion/id360608725) *This one might take the rest of my life to get through. It's very enjoyable, but Neal Stephenson never met a detail he didn't love to throw in as a 15 page aside.*

### Movies and TV

- [My Neighbor Totoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro) *Rewatched this again for my daughter's birthday. So good. We watched it in Japanese, of course, because, hey, I speak it, and she's in her second quarter of Japanese class. It's a lot of fun talking about the use of language and the subtitles vs. the original script.*
- [Godzilla Minus One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_Minus_One) *This is better than anything the Monsterverse has given us. You will feel the feels. So many layers, and I'm not talking about scales on a giant lizard.*
- [The Last of Us](https://www.hbo.com/the-last-of-us) *Human fungal infections are on the rise, so this hits a little too close to home, maybe, but I'm kind of enjoying it. I'm watching this **super** slowly.*
- [The Wind Rises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises) *Legend*

***Recently Finished***

- [For All Mankind](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/for-all-mankind/umc.cmc.6wsi780sz5tdbqcf11k76mkp7) *Another great one from Apple TV+*
- [Monarch: Legacy of Monsters](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/monarch-legacy-of-monsters/umc.cmc.62l8x0ixrhyq3yaqa5y8yo7ew) *I'm sticking with it, even though the quality is a little up and down.*
- [Slow Horses](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/slow-horses/umc.cmc.2szz3fdt71tl1ulnbp8utgq5o) *Top.Notch.TV.*

### Food and Drink

- Cutting out beer for a full month

### Projects

- Learning all about customizing QMK keyboards with [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/)
- Helping Ronnie and Vic on [The Liner Project](https://thelinerproject.com) website. *Next up is optimized images so Ronnie can throw pictures in blog posts, which I should probably start actually working on.*
- Trying to come up with a light theme that I actually like for my own site. Blue. There has to be blue.

### Learning

- SwiftUI
- Python
- Raycast extension development

### Fitness

- Yoga
- Running
- Cycling
- HIIT
- Body weight and core exercises

I'm really going back to longer runs and bike rides again after a period of much needed variation and focus on HIIT and body weight exercises. Yoga is always a constant. I do some yoga almost daily.

### Family

- Trying to get two cats to tolerate each other. It's taking forever.
