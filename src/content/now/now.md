### Books

- [The Three-Body Problem - Tor Publishing Group](https://torpublishinggroup.com/the-three-body-problem/) *I FINALLY FINISHED THIS BOOK!! I think in most ways, it's better than the 3 Body Problem TV show on Netflix. But I'm not 100% sure I enjoyed either enough to recommend them at this point. That's a reverse on what I told Peter on [Friends with Brews](https://friendswithbrews.com), when I told him to watch the Netflix series, but it's how I feel at the momement.*
- [Kingdom of Play | Book by David Toomey | Official Publisher Page | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kingdom-of-Play/David-Toomey/9781982154462) *This is a pretty fascinating look at an under-studied element of animal life – the fact that animals play. But why? How does play benefit animals trying to survive in the ruthless foodchain that is their lives? I rented this from the library and now I'm waiting for it again (didn't finish in time).*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*

### Movies and TV

- [Your Honor - Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81684531) *Bryan Cranston is always at his best when he's trying to clean up his own messes. I'm only 4 episodes in, but I will watch this whole thing for sure.*

- [ETHIOPIA – DOMA Coffee Roasting Company](https://www.domacoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/ethiopia) *I need a couple more brews of this to decide how much I like it, but it's certainly inoffensive.*
