### TV Shows

[![Your Friends & Neighbors • 2025 • Bear in mind only two episodes have aired, so small sample size, but this is 100% my new favorite TV show. I didn't even intend to watch it until a friend mentioned it, and wow! Glad they did. • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage42Fa9F653B0-review-9052cb89-9c11-4225-9f69-5aae19a048fa.png)](/images/posts/PngImage42Fa9F653B0-review-9052cb89-9c11-4225-9f69-5aae19a048fa.jpg)
[![Zero Day • 2025 • Decent-ish premise, written wildly unrealistically. Robert De Niro is always good, Jesse Plemons was surprisingly good, and several others do their jobs admirably, but the writing is too corny and far-fetched to care. Cannot recommend. • Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4Ea792E5D80-review-e3dcb4e1-2d2e-474f-a9fe-add1f2c652ea.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4Ea792E5D80-review-e3dcb4e1-2d2e-474f-a9fe-add1f2c652ea.jpg)
