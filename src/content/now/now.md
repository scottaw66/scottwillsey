## Current Personal Status

Words. What do they mean? Truth is easily twisted. Liars lie. And that's how Portland is portrayed as "WAR RAVAGED", in the words of dementia man, [to send in the troops to Portland](https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/10/portland-ice-protest-national-guard-trump/684439/).

Well, f#$% those guys.

### Books

[<span hidden>Fluke ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ Brian Klaas ‚Ä¢ (In progress) You'd thinking finding out everything is random and our smallest choices and actions can change everything would be scary and depressing, but in fact this book is interesting and though provoking and not at all depressing. That sounds like I‚Äôm just tolerating it, but I‚Äôm in fact enjoying it quite a bit. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>To Say Nothing of the Dog ‚Ä¢ 2013 ‚Ä¢ Connie Willis ‚Ä¢ Book 3 of the Oxford Time Travel series. It's funny and cute and compelling, even if I miss Mr. Dunworthy's constant presence ala Doomsday Book. But Ned Henry and all the other characters make this a fun book that's hard to put down. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>The Equalizer 3 ‚Ä¢ 2023 ‚Ä¢ Antoine Fuqua ‚Ä¢ Sometimes you just want to watch crisp, effective killing of bad guys, and Denzel always delivers in spades. I particularly enjoyed watching Marco get stabbed with his own knife he was still holding. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Black Rabbit ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ It's hard to like the two main characters in this show, but they do become sympathetic characters over time. There's plenty of tension, action, and family dynamics to go around. Some people are bad for themselves and everyone around them. ‚Ä¢ Liked It</span>
