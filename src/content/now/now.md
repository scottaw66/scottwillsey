### Books

- [The Three-Body Problem - Tor Publishing Group](https://torpublishinggroup.com/the-three-body-problem/) *I've actually read this once, but it was a long time ago and since then I've seen season 1 of Netflix' 3 Body Problem. So review time it is. I also have the 2nd book in the series, The Dark Forest, which I plan to make it to by finishing this one first.*
- [Kingdom of Play | Book by David Toomey | Official Publisher Page | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kingdom-of-Play/David-Toomey/9781982154462) *This is a pretty fascinating look at an under-studied element of animal life – the fact that animals play. But why? How does play benefit animals trying to survive in the ruthless foodchain that is their lives? I rented this from the library and now I'm waiting for it again (didn't finish in time).*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*

### Movies and TV

- [Mad Max: Fury Road](https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/mad-max-fury-road) *Started watching this while it was available "free" on Apple TV+ and then it was removed again before I finished. Dammit. I will finish this.*
- [Dark Matter](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/dark-matter/umc.cmc.4luj45vtqpmjsvb6sc2675oeg) *It started pretty well, but it's starting to draaaaaaaaaaaggggggggg just a little bit.*

### Food and Drink

- [Decaf Colombia Amigos del Huila – Dapper & Wise](https://dapperandwise.com/collections/coffee/products/decaf-rwanda-baho?variant=44503883252021) *It's a quite good decaf. I think I've been lucky with decafs, there hasn't been one I've tried and not liked so far.*
- [LOVELY’S FIFTY FIFTY](https://www.lovelys5050.com/) *Went here again with the work gang not too long ago. It's so amazing. Just go.*

### Projects

- Updated the site's dark and light modes and widened the body in large viewports.
- I am going to start a project to make this site accessible.
- I am going to start another project to document revisions of the site because I have no visual history of the changes it's gone through over the years.
