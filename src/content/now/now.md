## Current Personal Status

I've made progress on digging up the Chinese Empress roots in the backyard, but it's not dead yet. It will be.

I've also started playing with using [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) with my ChatGPT account login for various tasks, and it's gotten quite good. I think I could get rid of Claude Code and my Claude account, except Claude still supports more MCP servers and app connectors.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Movies

[<span hidden>Ballerina • 2025 • Len Wiseman • Sometimes you just want to see people get shot and stabbed, and this is a lot of fun for that. John Wick movies always have interesting choreography and fights. Ana de Armas is fine as Eve and the action is all very well done. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Dark Winds Season 1 • 2022 • Dark Winds started off incredibly well - suspenseful, well-paced, well-written, and then faded slightly as it reached the end of season 1. Readers will know I find this to be an issue with much of TV. Still, I loved it and recommend season 1! • Loved It!</span>
