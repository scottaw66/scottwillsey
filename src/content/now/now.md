### Books

[<span hidden>When the Moon Hits Your Eye • 2025 • John Scalzi This is what should be called a silly, maybe even dumb, book. But it isn't. It's fun. And it manages to make a few relevant points about humanity along the way. • Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>Doomsday Book • 1992 • Connie Willis A time traveler from the near future goes back to England of the 14th century and stumbles into the Black Death wiping everyone out all around her. Sounds horrible - and yet, it's a wonderful book. There are compelling characters in the future and in the past, and it's somehow compelling even while being a horrific portrayal of the plague. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Dope Thief S1 • 2025 • I can't decided how l'd rate this overall, because it does have some slow moving points and a couple glaring weaknesses. But it's also one of the shows I look forward to the most. So... I guess I love it? • Loved It!</span>

<span hidden>The Diamond Heist • 2025 • This is worth a watch when you need something you don't have to feel too invested in - it's fun and kind of funny. It's also a bit ludicrous and not to be confused with anything other than frivolous entertainment. • Liked It</span>

<span hidden>Your Friends & Neighbors • 2025 • Bear in mind only two episodes have aired, so small sample size, but this is 100% my new favorite TV show. I didn't even intend to watch it until a friend mentioned it, and wow! Glad they did. • Loved It!</span>
