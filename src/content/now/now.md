## Current Personal Status

> This is a point in my life where what I need to do requires me to ignore and or overcome all sense of imposter syndrome and just get it done. The exciting thing is, if I can do it, I can make a living situation goal come true for us. There is incentive and it is exciting!

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Movies

[<span hidden>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy • 2011 • Tomas Alfredson • They don't make many movies like this anymore. Both intelligently written and yet not overly- wrought with twists and surprises, it's a subtly played movie staring Gary Oldman at his best, but with a stellar cast in general. Highly recommended. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Sean Combs: The Reckoning • 2025 • I kind of watched this like you'd watch any train wreck, but truly it is interesting. 50 Cent should be given props for deciding to go all in on showing what a terrible human being Combs is. • Liked It</span>

### Music

[<span hidden>primitive god • 2022 • Chris Ballew • I had no idea who Chris Ballew was (although obviously I'd heard of the Presidents of the United States of America) until I stumbled across his albums in Apple Music recently. To say he's prodigious is an understatement, but the good news is that a lot of it is very good, including "primitive god". Love it! • Loved It!</span>
