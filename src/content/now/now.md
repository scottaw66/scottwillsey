### Books

[<span hidden>Things Become Other Things ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ Craig Mod Craig has been wandering Japan on foot for decades, photographing and talking and observing, and he does brings the experience to life in a very spiritual way.

I'm hooked and trying to keep from racing through this. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>When the Moon Hits Your Eye ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ John Scalzi This is what should be called a silly, maybe even dumb, book. But it isn't. It's fun. And it manages to make a few relevant points about humanity along the way. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Havoc ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ Gareth Evans ‚Ä¢ I made it 5 minutes into this movie and shut it off. It's that stupid. I don't know if this is intentionally dumb, parody style, or if it's unconsciously dumb. Either way, it IS dumb. ‚Ä¢ Didn't Like It</span>
