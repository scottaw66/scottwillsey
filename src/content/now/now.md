### Movies and TV

- [Somebody Feed Phil – Season 7 | Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80146601) *Usually when I recommend things to people, I assume they won't bother, and that's fine. But this is one that is NOT fine to skip. JUST. WATCH. IT. It'll make you happy, it'll make you hungry, but most of all it'll stir your imagination for food and travel.*
- [Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow | WarnerBros.com](https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/edge-tomorrow) *I had seen trailers for this movie in the past and I just assumed it was a stupid "vs. Alien" movie about a guy in an exosuit. I could not have been more wrong. I did not expect to love this movie, I didn't necessarily want to love this movie, but I did in fact love this movie.*

### Projects

- Creating a wiki site for myself for links and topic notes. I also would like to create a private home wiki for my family, inspired by [Jason](https://grepjason.sh) of [Hemispheric Views Podcast](https://hemisphericviews.com/).
- Revamping this site's [Uses](https://scottwillsey.com/uses/) page.

### Apple Home

- Installed an [Eve Outdoor Cam](https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-outdoor-cam) to cover a front-of-house blind spot. This is a combination light and camera so it replaces one of the outdoor lights to the side of the garage.
