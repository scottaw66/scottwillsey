### Books

- [We Don't Need Roads by Caseen Gaines | PenguinRandomHouse.com](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/316487/we-dont-need-roads-by-caseen-gaines/) *A history of the making of the Back to the Future trilogy. It's a good book, not a great book. It reads like a book report written by a fan at times rather than an act of journalism, but it has its moments.*
- [Lost Japan](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/273227/lost-japan-by-kerr-alex/9780141979755) *Alex Kerr is a gaijin living in Japan who despairs at the loss of culture in the name of progress, and who also works to restore old buildings in various parts of Japan.*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*

### Movies and TV

- [Somebody Feed Phil – Season 7 | Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80146601) *Usually when I recommend things to people, I assume they won't bother, and that's fine. But this is one that is NOT fine to skip. JUST. WATCH. IT. It'll make you happy, it'll make you hungry, but most of all it'll stir your imagination for food and travel.*

### Projects

- *Update: I may actually use Notion for this instead of a website.* Creating a wiki site for myself for links and topic notes. I also would like to create a private home wiki for my family, inspired by [Jason](https://grepjason.sh) of [Hemispheric Views Podcast](https://hemisphericviews.com/).
- (Still) revamping this site's [Uses](https://scottwillsey.com/uses/) page.

### Apple Home

- Added an [Eve Outdoor Cam](https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-outdoor-cam) to our HomeKit setup to cover a front-of-house blind spot. This is a combination light and camera so it replaces one of the outdoor lights to the side of the garage.
- Also added 3 [eufyCam S220 (eufyCam 2C Pro) | eufy US](https://us.eufy.com/products/t88611d1) cameras to cover the rest of the perimeter. These battery-powered cameras are HomeKit Secure Video compatible.
