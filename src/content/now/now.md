## Current Personal Status
>
> I've completely automated every aspect of creating a blog post in Astro just by writing a post in Obsidian and running a script. It handles images, link posts, keywords (tags), and more. It's so great.

## Current Projects

- Learning Korean
- Expanding Paradigm's client base and launching its vulnerabilty management service
- Building up my running distance again

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>Grid to Glory • 2025 • Alex Jacques • Alex Jacques is one of my favorite F1 commentators. His personality shines, and he's clearly a hard worker who knows what he's doing. The stories he's chosen for this book are compelling, but the writing style pulls me out of them. He uses sentence fragments instead of commas, and sometimes the background explanations are slightly muddled. Good, not great. • Decent</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy • 2011 • Tomas Alfredson • They don't make many movies like this anymore. Both intelligently written and yet not overly- wrought with twists and surprises, it's a subtly played movie staring Gary Oldman at his best, but with a stellar cast in general. Highly recommended. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Plur1bus 1 • First Time Watch • 2025 • l've seen complaints about the slow pacing, but the people saying this must have never watched anything from Vince Gilligan before. He is NOT afraid to build a story. Season 1 was weird and compelling. Recommend! • Loved It!</span>

### Music

[<span hidden>primitive god • 2022 • Chris Ballew • I had no idea who Chris Ballew was (although obviously I'd heard of the Presidents of the United States of America) until I stumbled across his albums in Apple Music recently. To say he's prodigious is an understatement, but the good news is that a lot of it is very good, including "primitive god". Love it! • Loved It!</span>
