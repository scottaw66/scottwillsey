### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. ðŸ˜ž*

- [Inside Mercedes F1 â€“ Life in the Fast Lane](https://books.apple.com/us/book/inside-mercedes-f1/id6477808292) *F1 and reading, two of my main passions. Still, it's not often that I find a book **about** F1 that I actually want to read. This is one. It's told from an honest, intelligent perspective by an outsider. I heard Matt on The Race podcast talking to Ed Straw about his book and I knew I had to buy it.*
- [Polostan â€“ Volume One of Bomb Light](https://books.apple.com/us/book/polostan/id6474502267) *FINISHED - a good start to a new Neal Stephenson series, with lots of the usual info-dumps that somehow are fun coming from him.*
- [Guerrilla Marketing in 30 Days](https://books.apple.com/us/book/guerrilla-marketing-in-30-days/id843779604) *Marketing. I can't do it.*
- [Build, Run, and Sell Your Apple Consulting Practice: Business and Marketing for iOS and Mac Start Ups | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-3835-6) *This book is by Charles Edge, much missed MacAdmins guru. The lessons in here are applicable to consulting in general.*

### Movies

- [Sicario: Day of the Soldado](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/400535-sicario-day-of-the-soldado-2018) *I liked the first one with Emily Blunt as the fish out of water much better, but this is a pretty good movie. It's weird that Graver and Gillick seem to be redeemed here, as though their crimes and corrupt personas in the 2015 Sicario weren't really them. ðŸ¤·*

### TV Shows

- [Pachinko Season 1 Episode 8 â€“ Chapter Eight](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/110382-pachinko/season/1/episode/8) *Pachinko is so beautiful and haunting and hard to watch. It really is an absolute must see.*
- [Pachinko Season 1 Episode 7 â€“ Chapter Seven](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/110382-pachinko/season/1/episode/7)
- [Bad Sisters Season 2 Episode 3 â€“ Missing](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/199318-bad-sisters/season/2/episode/3) *OMG, I didn't think Bad Sisters could get any better! ðŸ¤¯*
- [Shrinking Season 2 Episode 7 â€“ Get in the Sea](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/136311-shrinking/season/2/episode/7) *I still have mixed feelings about Shrinking. It's too sitcom like in some ways, but super amazing in others. The characters all seem the same in terms of their "witty banter" though. I don't like it when the characters are clearly just the writers.*
- [Pachinko Season 1 Episode 6 â€“ Chapter Six](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/110382-pachinko/season/1/episode/6)
- [Pachinko Season 1 Episode 5 â€“ Chapter Five](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/110382-pachinko/season/1/episode/5)

### Projects

- **trakt-history-py**

Python version of Trakt history grabber for updating my [/now](https://scottwillsey.com/now/) page. I want to be able to grab my trakt history and format it for the Movies and TV section of this /now page using a Raycast Script Command. I don't update trakt directly, rather I am using the excellent [Sequel app](https://www.getsequel.app) to track shows and movies (and also books).

It now internally incorporates the parts of [pytrakt3000](https://github.com/scottaw66/pytrakt3000) that I'm actually using and doesn't need to import it any longer, so it's now a standalone utility.

*[https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py)*

- **pytrakt3000: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API**

This is a fork of [glensc/python-pytrakt: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API](https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt) and is a module for using the Trakt API. My [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) utility mentioned above used to import and use this.

*I'm no longer actually using this as I incorporated the parts I was using into [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) itself.*
