## Current Personal Status

> Created a cli dashboard for my website related utility scripts, which is nice - one place to run them all that does not depend on Shortcuts for anything.

## Current Projects

- Japanese and Korean study (somewhat proficient in J, complete newb to K)

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>The Convenience Store by the Sea • First Time Read • 2020 • Sonoko Machida • I didn't know what to think of this book initially.
