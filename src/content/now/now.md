### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. 😞*

- [Codex](https://books.apple.com/us/book/codex/id6468021882) *Finished. I rated this ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ even though I didn't really enjoy the ending, I have to confess. Still well worth the read.*
- [Livesuit by James S. A. Corey | Hachette Book Group](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/james-s-a-corey/livesuit/9780316575348/) *Finished. Great premise, great novella.*
- [The Man Who Lied to His Laptop — Clifford Nass & Corina Yen](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-man-who-lied-to-his-laptop/id385166427) *In progress. This is not a novel, but it **IS** a novel look at how people interact with and anthropomorphize technology.*
- [Dark Wire](https://books.apple.com/us/book/dark-wire/id6468445801) *Finished. The inside story of the largest law-enforcement sting operation ever, in which the FBI made its own tech start-up to wiretap the world, shows how cunning both the authorities and drug traffickers have become, with privacy implications for everyone.*

### Movies and TV

- [Meltdown – Three Mile Island](https://www.netflix.com/title/81198239) *I never realized how close TMI came to having a full core meltdown. I also didn't know the story about Bechtel trying to use a crane that would have destroyed the core too. So there's your cheerful tale of nuclear woe.*
