## Current Personal Status
>
> AI is a tool and I don't understand how people become obsessed with their AI "friend". I don't even like it when I ask a question about a couple Python modules and it answers and then follows up with "What are you building?" Hey, if you need to know, I will tell you, ok?

## Current Projects

- Learning Korean
- Expanding our client base
- Working on steps to making my family's life better by achieving some family life goals

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Movies

[<span hidden>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy • 2011 • Tomas Alfredson • They don't make many movies like this anymore. Both intelligently written and yet not overly- wrought with twists and surprises, it's a subtly played movie staring Gary Oldman at his best, but with a stellar cast in general. Highly recommended. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

### Music

[<span hidden>primitive god • 2022 • Chris Ballew • I had no idea who Chris Ballew was (although obviously I'd heard of the Presidents of the United States of America) until I stumbled across his albums in Apple Music recently. To say he's prodigious is an understatement, but the good news is that a lot of it is very good, including "primitive god". Love it! • Loved It!</span>
