## Current Personal Status

I've been using [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) as my terminal app of choice, but now that the Claude and Claude Code combination is as good as it is, and integrates with so many things, I just found the Warp AI stuff getting in my way and getting annoying. So I spent last night (while my daughter and her friends were out terrorizing the trick-or-treaters) setting up a [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) configuration I liked.

All told, I wound up setting up [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/), [Starship](https://starship.rs), and [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). And now I really like it.

You can see from my [YouTube history](#youtube) below that I also jumped around in several Ghostty related videos too. 😄

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Slow Horses • 2022 • Season 5 review: The last episode stumbled for me a bit. A few highly unlikely moments, those always take me out of a show. Not, I'm not changing, so forget it. But overall, it's still Slow Horses. • Liked It</span>
