### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. ðŸ˜ž*  

[![Chasing Shadows â€¢ Just started it... The story of Citizen Lab, the world's foremost digital watchdog. Encouraging and depressing all at once. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4D3CB166480-review-ae16dbc0-ca2c-4deb-b0a9-90c68a0b2f1d.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4D3CB166480-review-ae16dbc0-ca2c-4deb-b0a9-90c68a0b2f1d.jpg)
[![Fluke â€¢ Just started it, but it's both intellectually interesting and a nice counterpoint to the religion of determinism. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Fluke-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.png)](/images/posts/Fluke-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.jpg)

### Movies

[![Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief â€¢ 2015 â€¢ Alex Gibney Scientology is weird. Ron Hubbard was weird and evil. David Miscavige is just plain evil. An interesting documentary about a rotten church. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4B5BB133Ca0-review-a10625ab-89dc-4214-a9f7-96ab31198f8c.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4B5BB133Ca0-review-a10625ab-89dc-4214-a9f7-96ab31198f8c.jpg)

### TV Shows

[![Zero Day â€¢ 2025 â€¢ Decent-ish premise, written wildly unrealistically. Robert De Niro is always good, Jesse Plemons was surprisingly good, and several others do their jobs admirably, but the writing is too corny and far-fetched to care. Cannot recommend. â€¢ Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4Ea792E5D80-review-e3dcb4e1-2d2e-474f-a9fe-add1f2c652ea.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4Ea792E5D80-review-e3dcb4e1-2d2e-474f-a9fe-add1f2c652ea.jpg)

### Music

[![Magic Monkey â€¢ Godiego â€¢ 1980 â€¢ A childhood favorite from when I lived in Kagoshima, Japan. Apparently Apple Music has heard of Godiego, so hey! Good work, Apple! â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage454BBeceCf0-review-ec28f74f-944a-481b-8c4c-3fd78be89229.png)](/images/posts/PngImage454BBeceCf0-review-ec28f74f-944a-481b-8c4c-3fd78be89229.jpg)
