### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. üòû*

- [The Internet of Garbage by Sarah Jeong - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17777330/internet-of-garbage-book-sarah-jeong-online-harassment) *Just started. Probably shouldn't read this in 2024, the year of the great enshittification.*
- [The Apollo Murders](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-apollo-murders/id1552671476) *So far so good. It seems like a bit of a stolen concept from For All Mankind, but it's different enough and engaging enough that I don't mind.*
