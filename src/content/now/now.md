### Projects

- *Update: I may actually use Notion for this instead of a website.* Creating a wiki site for myself for links and topic notes. I also would like to create a private home wiki for my family, inspired by [Jason](https://grepjason.sh) of [Hemispheric Views Podcast](https://hemisphericviews.com/).
- (Still) revamping this site's [Uses](https://scottwillsey.com/uses/) page.

### Apple Home

- Added an [Eve Outdoor Cam](https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-outdoor-cam) to our HomeKit setup to cover a front-of-house blind spot. This is a combination light and camera so it replaces one of the outdoor lights to the side of the garage.
- Also added 2 [eufyCam S220 (eufyCam 2C Pro) | eufy US](https://us.eufy.com/products/t88611d1) and 1 [eufyCam S221 (eufyCam 2 Pro)](https://us.eufy.com/products/t88511d1) cameras to cover the rest of the perimeter. They are battery-powered cameras and HomeKit Secure Video compatible.
