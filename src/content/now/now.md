### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. ðŸ˜ž*  

[![Chasing Shadows â€¢ Just started it... the story of Citizen Lab, the world's foremost digital watchdog. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/ChasingShadowsReview-4dbe97f8-0347-4893-86d8-2d9da417e159.png)](/images/posts/ChasingShadowsReview-4dbe97f8-0347-4893-86d8-2d9da417e159.jpg)
[![Fluke â€¢ Just started it, but it's both intellectually interesting and a nice counterpoint to the religion of determinism. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Fluke-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.png)](/images/posts/Fluke-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.jpg)
[![The Silo Series Collection â€¢ One of the best dystopian series ever written. Kind of hard to read in early 2025 though. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Silo-Series-Collection-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.png)](/images/posts/Silo-Series-Collection-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.jpg)

### Movies

[![To Live and Die in L.A. 1985 â€¢ William Friedkin â€¢ Not as good as I remembered. Everyone in this is evil, or an idiot. I didn't buy the transformation of John Vukovich. He didn't earn it. Dafoe is stellar, of course. Decent](../../assets/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.png)](/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.jpg)
[![The Princess Bride 1987 â€¢ Rob Reiner â€¢ A multiple rewatch, of course, but one of the greatest movies ever. So many classic lines and characters. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/ThePrincessBrideReview-be189bc8-20cc-44eb-b5c6-3a39d917defb.png)](/images/posts/ThePrincessBrideReview-be189bc8-20cc-44eb-b5c6-3a39d917defb.jpg)
[![Small Things Like these â€¢ The ending left me with MANY questions, but what an excellent and haunting movie. Cillian Murphy is amazing here and Emily Watson embodies the compassionless preacher of compassion like no other. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Small-Things-Like-These-review-B7EA41BD-78D5-4E3B-AAD4-BE16300AED91.png)](/images/posts/Small-Things-Like-These-review-B7EA41BD-78D5-4E3B-AAD4-BE16300AED91.jpg)
[![Cold Blood â€¢ Jean Reno is always interesting, and Sarah Lind did a good job, but the plot was weird and the ending unsatisfying. â€¢ Decent](../../assets/images/posts/Cold-Blood-review-2ECDD41C-4181-4540-9E06-BBA87F1D3EF5.png)](/images/posts/Cold-Blood-review-2ECDD41C-4181-4540-9E06-BBA87F1D3EF5.jpg)

### TV Shows

[![American Murder: Gabby Petito â€¢ 2025 â€¢ A very well done documentary on an age old problem. Depressing but also uplifting at times. Don't watch if you're not in a good place. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage40C6A17DB10-review-cc7cc661-18f8-4d71-ac1f-d67b5a7af69b.png)](/images/posts/PngImage40C6A17DB10-review-cc7cc661-18f8-4d71-ac1f-d67b5a7af69b.jpg)
[![Vietnam: The War That Changed America â€¢ 2025 â€¢ Overall, very well done - depressing, uplifting, maddening, inspiring, and insightful either way. I think some of the things chosen to focus on were a bit off, but mostly they nailed it. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4E32Ad42D80-review-af9dd394-2bff-4e5b-8f59-771f03a2bf41.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4E32Ad42D80-review-af9dd394-2bff-4e5b-8f59-771f03a2bf41.jpg)
[![Senna â€¢ 2024 â€¢ Senna's story is compelling but this series failed to capture Fl racing in a realistic way. Don't recommend for anyone who actually knows Fl or the Senna story already. â€¢ Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.png)](/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.jpg)
[![Surviving Black Hawk Down â€¢ Everyone knows the Black Hawk Down story - here are some people who were there. A good documentary, with views from all sides. It was two terrible days that never should have happened. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/SurvivingBlackHawkDownReview-a6d3b952-df30-4f46-b9d7-845e7b6a3fce.png)](/images/posts/SurvivingBlackHawkDownReview-a6d3b952-df30-4f46-b9d7-845e7b6a3fce.jpg)
[![Mr Inbetween â€¢ 2018 â€¢ Finished all 3 seasons, and apparently | *HAD* watched the whole thing. But it's good enough to watch again. And probably again. Great show! â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/MrInbetweenReview-7ee14a41-5583-4682-8738-833a6761ec40.png)](/images/posts/MrInbetweenReview-7ee14a41-5583-4682-8738-833a6761ec40.jpg)
