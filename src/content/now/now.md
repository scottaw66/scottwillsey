### TV Shows

[![Senna 2024 Senna's story is compelling but this series failed to capture Fl racing in a realistic way. Don't recommend for anyone who actually knows Fl or the Senna story already. Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.png)](/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.jpg)
[![Surviving Black Hawk Down Everyone knows the Black Hawk Down story - here are some people who were there. A good documentary, with views from all sides. It was two terrible days that never should have happened. Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/SurvivingBlackHawkDownReview-a6d3b952-df30-4f46-b9d7-845e7b6a3fce.png)](/images/posts/SurvivingBlackHawkDownReview-a6d3b952-df30-4f46-b9d7-845e7b6a3fce.jpg)
[![Mr Inbetween 2018 Finished all 3 seasons, and apparently | *HAD* watched the whole thing. But it's good enough to watch again. And probably again. Great show! Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/MrInbetweenReview-7ee14a41-5583-4682-8738-833a6761ec40.png)](/images/posts/MrInbetweenReview-7ee14a41-5583-4682-8738-833a6761ec40.jpg)
[![The Recruit 2022 I'm on SlE6, and it's redeeming itself a bit. I'm OK with it. Still overly implausible, but fun. Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/TheRecruitReview-ef34ad0e-5a15-45f6-b7f4-540af194ee5d.png)](/images/posts/TheRecruitReview-ef34ad0e-5a15-45f6-b7f4-540af194ee5d.jpg)
