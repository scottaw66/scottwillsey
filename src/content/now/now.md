## Current Personal Status

So many things. So many tireds. What a time we live in.

I was reminded today that we should treat all relationships uniquely. Someone may be the polar opposite of us politically, but still be someone we can talk to and try to build common ground with. I'm not saying we need to engage everyone with that motive, but at least try it with longstanding relationships where the other person has fallen prey to lies and nonsense but you can still talk with them about other things. Connections are important. Remembering that other people are humans is important. It helps to avoid things like civil wars.

It doesn't mean you have to be besties with people that ultimately can be hard to be around. It just means sometimes try to find common ground on other things.

### Books

[<span hidden>Fluke • 2025 • Brian Klaas • (In progress) You'd thinking finding out everything is random and our smallest choices and actions can change everything would be scary and depressing, but in fact this book is interesting and though provoking and not at all depressing. That sounds like I’m just tolerating it, but I’m in fact enjoying it quite a bit. • Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>To Say Nothing of the Dog • 2013 • Connie Willis • Book 3 of the Oxford Time Travel series. It's funny and cute and compelling, even if I miss Mr. Dunworthy's constant presence ala Doomsday Book. But Ned Henry and all the other characters make this a fun book that's hard to put down. • Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>The Equalizer 3 • 2023 • Antoine Fuqua • Sometimes you just want to watch crisp, effective killing of bad guys, and Denzel always delivers in spades. I particularly enjoyed watching Marco get stabbed with his own knife he was still holding. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Black Rabbit • 2025 • It's hard to like the two main characters in this show, but they do become sympathetic characters over time. There's plenty of tension, action, and family dynamics to go around. Some people are bad for themselves and everyone around them. • Liked It</span>
