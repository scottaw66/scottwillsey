### Current Personal Status

Somehow I've managed to be sick the majority of the 3 weeks I've been back from Japan. EVEN MORE REASON I SHOULD NEVER HAVE COME BACK!!

Oh, well.

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>Sir Lewis • 2025 • Michael Sawyer Look. Lewis is an actual role model, and he's also a true legend. This book was just a little too willing to bypass nuances in a couple cases and overstate its case. It did not need to do that, because Lewis' life and work speaks for itself. • Liked It</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Ballerina • 2025 • Len Wiseman • Sometimes you just want to see people get shot and stabbed, and this is a lot of fun for that. John Wick movies always have interesting choreography and fights. Ana de Armas is fine as Eve and the action is all very well done. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Murderbot S1 • 2025 • I didn't expect to love this. I didn't even want to like it after a couple episodes. But I do! I love it! It's fun and somehow heartwarming. • Loved It!</span>

### Food and Drink

- [Home | ramen-ryoma](https://www.ramenryoma.net/) Don't get me wrong, it's very good, but... it's not Japan. IT'S NOT JAPAN!!
- [Fuji Ramen](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=24-5,%20Asakusa%201-Ch%C5%8Dme,%20Taito,%20Tokyo,%20Japan%20111-0032&coordinate=35.712421,139.792413&name=Fuji%20Ramen&place-id=I8EE20D2C8493F88&map=explore) (富士らーめん) in Asakusa, Tokyo – A great ramen shop with a very friendly owner who tries to learn the languages of all his foreign guests. The ramen was delicious.
- [Matcha Cafe](instagram.com/kotobukiseian) in Asakusa, Tokyo – Wow, the matcha shakes and the matcha pudding and the Mozzarella cheese toast!
- [Michiya Tonkatsu](https://michiya-kagoshima.com/) (みちや) in Kagoshima – The best tonkatsu – not *I think*, but *I KNOW*, I've ever had, and I've had a lot of tonkatsu.
