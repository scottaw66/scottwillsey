## Current Personal Status

If you want to collaborate on any writing projects along the lines of things I write on this site, or if you want to inquire about IT/Computing services for your small to medium-sized business, get in touch on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@scottwillsey) or [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/scottwillsey.com)! I'm open for work possibilities.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Dark Winds • 2022 • Season 3 - Just starting Season 3. I think this series has evolved from a "must watch" to "there are things I like about it, and I'll get to it when and if I have time" show for me. There's a funny couple cameos in S3E1 though. • Liked It</span>
