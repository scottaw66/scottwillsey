### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. üòû*

- [Fluke | Book by Brian Klaas | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Fluke/Brian-Klaas/9781668006535) *Determinists should read this with an open mind.*
