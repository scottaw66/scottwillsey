## Current Personal Status
>
> I started setting up the Sophos XGS 88 but it didn't go super well. Simple Setup never finished correctly and I'm going to wind up manually configuring everything. On top of it, although it seemed to be doling out IP addresses to my devices, none of them could reach the internet. For the sake of other humans in my house, I called it a day and put everything back to normal until everyone's out of the house except me sometime.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Movies

[<span hidden>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy • 2011 • Tomas Alfredson • They don't make many movies like this anymore. Both intelligently written and yet not overly- wrought with twists and surprises, it's a subtly played movie staring Gary Oldman at his best, but with a stellar cast in general. Highly recommended. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows
