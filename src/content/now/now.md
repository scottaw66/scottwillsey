### Projects

- **trakt-history-py**

Python version of Trakt history grabber for updating my [/now](https://scottwillsey.com/now/) page. I want to be able to grab my trakt history and format it for the Movies and TV section of this /now page using a Raycast Script Command. I don't update trakt directly, rather I am using the excellent [Sequel app](https://www.getsequel.app) to track shows and movies (and also books).

- **pytrakt3000: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API**

This is a fork of [glensc/python-pytrakt: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API](https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt) and is a module for using the Trakt API. My [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) utility mentioned above imports and uses this.
