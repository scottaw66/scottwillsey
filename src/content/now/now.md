### Books

[<span hidden>Things Become Other Things • 2025 • Craig Mod Craig has been wandering Japan on foot for decades, photographing and talking and observing, and he does brings the experience to life in a very spiritual way. He brings to life the importance of caring about things in the way that modern techno-fascist ideologies do exactly the opposite of. I'm hooked and trying to keep from racing through this. • Loved It!</span>

### Movies
