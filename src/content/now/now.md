### Podcasts

- [Kramer Before Kramer - The Incomparable Mothership #704 - The Incomparable](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/704/)

### Books

- [Lost Japan](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/273227/lost-japan-by-kerr-alex/9780141979755) *Alex Kerr is a gaijin living in Japan who despairs at the loss of culture in the name of progress, and who also works to restore old buildings in various parts of Japan.*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*
- [Endless Loop: The History of the BASIC Programming Language (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)](https://www.amazon.com/Endless-Loop-Programming-All-purpose-Instruction/dp/1974277070) *It's just fun.*

***Stuck in Progress***

- [The Confusion](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-confusion/id360608725) *This one might take the rest of my life to get through. It's very enjoyable, but Neal Stephenson never met a detail he didn't love to throw in as a 15 page aside.*

### Movies and TV

- [Drive to Survive Season 6](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890) *Let's just be honest here. Drive to Surive is surface deep and makes up a lot of drama. This season, they just failed completely at the best parts of certain stories. Carlos Sainz literally manufactured his own victory in Singapore through clever intentional creation of a DRS train, and they didn't mention once or even show a single clip that indicated he was creating his own winning strategy. This is just one example of their vapidity, there are many like it. I've been watching F1 since 1974 when I discovered a big F1 photo book in a little bookstore in Karuizawa, Japan, and I think I'm generally not the audience for this show.*
- [Radioactive Forest: 10 Years After (2022) — The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/984118-radioactive-forest-10-years-after) *We watched this on [Curiosity Stream](https://curiositystream.com/) and enjoyed it. It's slightly dissatisfying in terms of conclusions – there aren't any strong ones – but that's life, because there's a lot we still don't understand about what long term effects there will be in this area due to radioactive contamination.*

***Recently Finished***

- [The Last of Us](https://www.hbo.com/the-last-of-us) *Human fungal infections are on the rise, so this hits a little too close to home, maybe, but I'm kind of enjoying it. I'm watching this **super** slowly.*

### Food and Drink

- [Trailhead Esmeralda](https://www.trailheadcoffeeroasters.com/coffee/p/esmeralda)
- [Colombia Del Campo | Broadcast | Trade Coffee](https://www.drinktrade.com/products/colombia-del-campo)

### Projects

- Creating a wiki site for myself for links and topic notes. I also would like to create a private home wiki for my family, inspired by [Jason](https://grepjason.sh) of [Hemispheric Views Podcast](https://hemisphericviews.com/).
- Trying to come up with a light theme that I actually like for my own site. Blue. There has to be blue.

### Fitness

- Yoga
- Running
- Cycling
- HIIT
- Body weight and core exercises

I'm really going back to longer runs and bike rides again after a period of much needed variation and focus on HIIT and body weight exercises. Yoga is always a constant. I do some yoga almost daily.

### Family

- Trying to get two cats to tolerate each other. It's taking forever. Don't expect this section to change for 6 or 7 years.
