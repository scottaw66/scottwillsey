### Books

- [Lost Japan](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/273227/lost-japan-by-kerr-alex/9780141979755) *Alex Kerr is a gaijin living in Japan who despairs at the loss of culture in the name of progress, and who also works to restore old buildings in various parts of Japan. Almost done with this one.*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*

### Movies and TV

- [3 Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/title/81024821) *No spoilers, but I found some of it excellent and some of it a bit disappointing. I have read book one of this but tbh I don't remember a lot of it.*

### Projects

- *Update: I may actually use Notion for this instead of a website.* Creating a wiki site for myself for links and topic notes. I also would like to create a private home wiki for my family, inspired by [Jason](https://grepjason.sh) of [Hemispheric Views Podcast](https://hemisphericviews.com/).
