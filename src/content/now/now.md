## Current Personal Status

Many vaccines were had, and I was sick for 2 days. PROOF THAT THEY'RE A SCAM!!!!!@#@!!

My 2024 M4 MacBook Pro has a broken Thunderbolt 5 port, just because I plug my hub into it all the time. I'm not rough. I don't abuse it. I just plug and unplug multiple times per day. Now that broken port is causing issues where the Mac can't go to sleep:

***panic(cpu 11 caller 0xfffffe003fad6598): Sleep transition timed out after 35 seconds while calling power state change callbacks. Suspected bundle: com.apple.iokit.IOThunderboltFamily. Thread 0x8b59f1.
Debugger message: panic***

### Books

[<span hidden>A History of What Comes Next ‚Ä¢ M Sylvain Neuvel ‚Ä¢ 2021 ‚Ä¢ A wonderful historical fiction novel that becomes... sci-fi? Yes, and it's a great premise too. It's not always an easy read, because there is a lot of tension and bad times, but it IS a worthy read. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

### Movies
