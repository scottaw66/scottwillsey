## Current Personal Status
>
> I just finished Sonoko Machida's 2020 book "The Convenience Store by the Sea", and I wish I had more. I think she has sequels. I'll have to see if they've been translated or not. I wouldn't mind owning them in Japanese also, but I'm a painfully slow novel reader in Japanese.

## Current Projects

- Learning Korean
- Expanding Paradigm's client base and launching its vulnerabilty management service
- Building up my running distance again

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>The Convenience Store by the Sea • First Time Read • 2020 • Sonoko Machida • I didn't know what to think of this book initially. It felt slightly stilted, whether due to translation or not, I'm not sure. But I kept reading. And it started drawing me in by brilliantly building intertwined moments of social interactions and vignettes of character development. • Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>Grid to Glory • 2025 • Alex Jacques • Alex Jacques is one of my favorite F1 commentators. His personality shines, and he's clearly a hard worker who knows what he's doing. The stories he's chosen for this book are compelling, but the writing style pulls me out of them. He uses sentence fragments instead of commas, and sometimes the background explanations are slightly muddled. Good, not great. • Decent</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>The Perfect Neighbor • First Time Watch • 2025 • Geeta Gandbhir • You kind of have to be into crime documentaries to like this, but the real takeaway here is how stupid Stand Your Ground laws and the people who think they're a good idea are. Also, this lady was whack. • Liked It</span>

[<span hidden>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy • 2011 • Tomas Alfredson • They don't make many movies like this anymore. Both intelligently written and yet not overly- wrought with twists and surprises, it's a subtly played movie staring Gary Oldman at his best, but with a stellar cast in general. Highly recommended. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Plur1bus 1 • First Time Watch • 2025 • l've seen complaints about the slow pacing, but the people saying this must have never watched anything from Vince Gilligan before. He is NOT afraid to build a story. Season 1 was weird and compelling. Recommend! • Loved It!</span>
