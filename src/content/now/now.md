### Books

[<span hidden>Things Become Other Things ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ Craig Mod Craig is a fascinating guy, not least because of the fact he's ingrained himself into the culture of Japan, a country I grew up in, but because he's an artful storyteller and photographer. In this book, he brings the reader along on one of his long walks through the Japan countryside as he ties the pieces of his past together with his present in a way that few people can. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Ballerina ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ Len Wiseman ‚Ä¢ Sometimes you just want to see people get shot and stabbed, and this is a lot of fun for that. John Wick movies always have interesting choreography and fights. Ana de Armas is fine as Eve and the action is all very well done. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Dark Winds Season 1 ‚Ä¢ 2022 ‚Ä¢ Dark Winds started off incredibly well - suspenseful, well-paced, well-written, and then faded slightly as it reached the end of season 1. Readers will know I find this to be an issue with much of TV. Still, I loved it and recommend season 1! ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>
