- [Codex](https://books.apple.com/us/book/codex/id6468021882) *Finished. I rated this ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è even though I didn't really enjoy the ending, I have to confess. Still well worth the read.*

- [The Man Who Lied to His Laptop ‚Äî Clifford Nass & Corina Yen](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-man-who-lied-to-his-laptop/id385166427) *In progress. This is not a novel, but it **IS** a novel look at how people interact with and anthropomorphize technology.*
- [Dark Wire](https://books.apple.com/us/book/dark-wire/id6468445801) *Finished.
