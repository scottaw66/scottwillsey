### Current Personal Status

Boy. I keep getting sick, and it's not helping me get things done. I also have the roots of a [Chinese Empress](https://www.bhg.com/gardening/trees-shrubs-vines/trees/empress-tree/) to dig out. It literally took over the entire underground of our backyard, and apparently some other yards too. Don't ever let your in-laws give you any Chinese Empress trees. They grow fast, are nice to look at, give great shade, but they take over the universe.

### Podcasts

[<span hidden>Things Become Other Things ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ Craig Mod Craig is a fascinating guy, not least because of the fact he's ingrained himself into the culture of Japan, a country I grew up in, but because he's an artful storyteller and photographer. In this book, he brings the reader along on one of his long walks through the Japan countryside as he ties the pieces of his past together with his present in a way that few people can. ‚Ä¢ Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Ballerina ‚Ä¢ 2025 ‚Ä¢ Len Wiseman ‚Ä¢ Sometimes you just want to see people get shot and stabbed, and this is a lot of fun for that.

### TV Shows
