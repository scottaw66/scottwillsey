### YouTube

Hey look, a YouTube section! I do use YouTube a lot to catch up on tech information or just to watch all the things people did wrong on Mt Everest right before they died, but YouTube is such a click-bait generator that it does require some care and ignoring 99% of what YouTube recommends.

### Books

**I'm progressing slowly here, but I actually am still reading these books.**  

I don't have a lot of time for reading these days, and usually by the time I get in bed I'm too tired to think so I just play solitaire or crosswords or Lex.games and then go to sleep. But I am reading these!

- [The Three-Body Problem - Tor Publishing Group](https://torpublishinggroup.com/the-three-body-problem/) *I've actually read this once, but it was a long time ago and since then I've seen season 1 of Netflix' 3 Body Problem. So review time it is. I also have the 2nd book in the series, The Dark Forest, which I plan to make it to by finishing this one first.*
- [Kingdom of Play | Book by David Toomey | Official Publisher Page | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kingdom-of-Play/David-Toomey/9781982154462) *This is a pretty fascinating look at an under-studied element of animal life – the fact that animals play. But why? How does play benefit animals trying to survive in the ruthless foodchain that is their lives? I rented this from the library and now I'm waiting for it again (didn't finish in time).*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*

### Movies and TV

- [The Town](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/23168) *Greatest movie ever? Most definitely not. But I did enjoy it at 1 am after a week of work.*
- [Dark Matter](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/dark-matter/umc.cmc.4luj45vtqpmjsvb6sc2675oeg) *Still watching. Still feels like they don't know how to make a compelling series last for however many episodes they have planned. LOTS of navel gazing and exposition, and I'm not necessarily opposed to focus on characters and story, but it's gotta be compelling.*

### Food and Drink

- [Toshi Restaurant](https://toshirestaurant.wixsite.com/beaverton) *This place has wonderful hot donburi, curry, and ramen, but the fresh sushi is worth its weight in gold (and costs it too).*
- [Home | ramen-ryoma](https://www.ramenryoma.net/) *You can get really good ramen here for a family without bankrupting yourself, and that's not nothing. In fact, it's quite something. You should go. Now. Today.*
