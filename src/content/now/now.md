### Books

- [The Man Who Lied to His Laptop — Clifford Nass & Corina Yen](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-man-who-lied-to-his-laptop/id385166427) *This is not a novel, but it **IS** a novel look at how people interact with and anthropomorphize technology.*
- [Kingdom of Play | Book by David Toomey | Official Publisher Page | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kingdom-of-Play/David-Toomey/9781982154462) *This is a fascinating look at an under-studied element of animal life – the fact that animals play (and dream). But why? How does play benefit animals trying to survive in the ruthless foodchain that is their lives?*
- [BOOK 2, REMEMBRANCE OF EARTH'S PAST › The Dark Forest Cixin Liu & Joel Martinsen >](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-dark-forest/id961788941) *Book 2 in the Three Body Problem series. As long as I can keep track of the characters, I'm looking forward to this because I've never read any of this one before. I don't think anything from this book was in season 1 of 3 Body Problem on Netflix, which is also good news for me.*

### Movies and TV

- [American Conspiracy - The Octopus Murders](https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81168725) *I know, I know, conspiracies. But this one appears to be a good old fashioned governmental overreach with the kinds of crazy characters that the Reagan administration couldn't get enough of. Reagan really was a bastard who did whatever it took to enforce his black and white view of the world upon everyone.*
- [Sunny ep 7 There's Been a Shift](https://tv.apple.com/us/episode/theres-been-a-shift/umc.cmc.5gagbb7lcybwolhlkt1l8masq?showId=umc.cmc.7c5t9dde8dxoaxwyl5rkuw38pp) *Last week's comments still apply: Have I decided whether this show is genius or whether it's just ambiance and delay tactics? No. No, I haven't. But at this point, I'm still willing to find out.*
- [Jackpot!](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1094138) *This movie is **SO DUMB** and **SO WEIRD** but it's also pretty funny. My wife was watching this when I came into the room and I couldn't stop watching until the end. Weird. I guess I needed something like this to make me forget whatever work-related garbage was destroying my soul at that moment.*
