### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. 😞*

- [Leave the World Behind](https://books.apple.com/us/book/leave-the-world-behind/id1493825355) *Just starting - I've actually started the Netflix movie based on the book but as usual with Netflix, I never feel like watching anything in my list when I do open the stupid app. Anyway, this is the book, and I like books.*
- [Polostan – Volume One of Bomb Light](https://books.apple.com/us/book/polostan/id6474502267) *FINISHED - a good start to a new Neal Stephenson series, with lots of the usual info-dumps that somehow are fun coming from him.*
- [Guerrilla Marketing in 30 Days](https://books.apple.com/us/book/guerrilla-marketing-in-30-days/id843779604) *Marketing. I can't do it.*
- [Build, Run, and Sell Your Apple Consulting Practice: Business and Marketing for iOS and Mac Start Ups | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-3835-6) *This book is by Charles Edge, much missed MacAdmins guru. The lessons in here are applicable to consulting in general.*

### Movies

- [Sicario: Day of the Soldado](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/400535-sicario-day-of-the-soldado-2018) *I liked the first one with Emily Blunt as the fish out of water much better, but this is a pretty good movie. It's weird that Graver and Gillick seem to be redeemed here, as though their crimes and corrupt personas in the 2015 Sicario weren't really them. 🤷*
- [Pain Hustlers](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862968-pain-hustlers-2023) *Quirky, funny, depressing. Recommended.*
- [Bad Boys: Ride or Die](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/573435-bad-boys-ride-or-die-2024) *I knew it would be horrible, and it did not disappoint.*
- [War for the Planet of the Apes](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/281338-war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-2017) *Best ever. Seriously, it is a really good movie.*
- [Wolfs](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/877817-wolfs-2024) *Two guys past the point where their charm overcomes a lame script, but it could have been worse, possibly.*

### TV Shows

- [Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn Season 1 Episode 2 – Chapter 2: Hostage Justice](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/231319-wanted-the-escape-of-carlos-ghosn/season/1/episode/2) *I always kind of assumed Ghosn was the criminal he was accused of being, but now I think at the very least Nissan wanted him gone and created this investigation to achieve that.*
- [Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn Season 1 Episode 1 – Chapter 1: Hubris](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/231319-wanted-the-escape-of-carlos-ghosn/season/1/episode/1)
- [Shrinking Season 2 Episode 4 – Made You Look](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/136311-shrinking/season/2/episode/4) *Shrinking is slightly annoying at times with how much everyone is a character with super witty banter because there aren't THAT many witty characters in one or two overlapping social circles, but it is a good show.*
- [Silo Season 1 Episode 10 – Outside](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/125988-silo/season/1/episode/10) *Someone told me the TV adaptation of Silo was good but not great, but I thought it was great, not good. Very enjoyable.*
- [This Is the Zodiac Speaking Season 1 Episode 3 – Box of Secrets](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/272299-this-is-the-zodiac-speaking/season/1/episode/3) *It's a little weird, but if I had to bet on one guy being Zodiak, it would be this guy.*
- [This Is the Zodiac Speaking Season 1 Episode 2 – Are You the Zodiac?](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/272299-this-is-the-zodiac-speaking/season/1/episode/2)

### Projects

- **trakt-history-py**

Python version of Trakt history grabber for updating my [/now](https://scottwillsey.com/now/) page. I want to be able to grab my trakt history and format it for the Movies and TV section of this /now page using a Raycast Script Command. I don't update trakt directly, rather I am using the excellent [Sequel app](https://www.getsequel.app) to track shows and movies (and also books).

It now internally incorporates the parts of [pytrakt3000](https://github.com/scottaw66/pytrakt3000) that I'm actually using and doesn't need to import it any longer, so it's now a standalone utility.

*[https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py)*

- **pytrakt3000: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API**

This is a fork of [glensc/python-pytrakt: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API](https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt) and is a module for using the Trakt API. My [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) utility mentioned above used to import and use this.

*I'm no longer actually using this as I incorporated the parts I was using into [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) itself.*
