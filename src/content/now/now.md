## Current Personal Status

In case you hadn't noticed, I redid the look of the site. I think it's nicer and easier on the eyes now. The old colors and fonts and article widths were getting on my nerves.

Tonight I had fun working on a bash script for a linux server that was failing to renew let's encrypt certs for sites with Cloudflare proxy enabled. The weird thing is that it does seem to work sometimes, on other servers with the same configuration.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>Buried in the Sky • 2012 • Climbers are nuts. People keep dying on these peaks in really unnecessary ways and it very often seems like the result of the most idiotic decisions on the part of people who are supposed to be experienced. Really gripping tale. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Dark Winds • 2022 • Season 3 - Just starting Season 3. I think this series has evolved from a "must watch" to "there are things I like about it, and I'll get to it when and if I have time" show for me. There's a funny couple cameos in S3E1 though. • Liked It</span>
