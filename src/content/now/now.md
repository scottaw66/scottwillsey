## Current Personal Status

I've made some tweaks to my site update scripts and my site build scripts. Everything automatically uploads to my server upon site build now, and the update scripts for various media histories on this /now page directly edit the /now page so there's even less for me to do now. Also, I can generate little thumbnails for food related links now.

If you want to collaborate on any writing projects along the lines of things I write on this site, or if you want to inquire about IT/Computing services for your small to medium-sized business, get in touch on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@scottwillsey) or [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/scottwillsey.com)! I'm open for work possibilities.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>Buried in the Sky • 2012 • Climbers are nuts. People keep dying on these peaks in really unnecessary ways and it very often seems like the result of the most idiotic decisions on the part of people who are supposed to be experienced. Really gripping tale. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>My Father, the BTK Killer • 2025 • Skye Borgman • I think I'Il blame all the annoying dreams I had last night on watching this before going to sleep. I do have a ton of sympathy for Kerri Rawson.
