### Podcasts

***Recently Finished***

- [The Incomparable 700: A Dark Totoro](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/700/) *Miyazaki movies can be inscrutable to us foreigners and it sounds like The Boy and the Heron is one of those weirdly Miyazaki films.*
- [Upgrade #496: 40th Anniversary of the Mac Draft - Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/496) *If you love the Mac like I do and you've used it for as long as I have, this may be one of the best episodes of any podcast you've ever listned to.*

### Books

- [Lost Japan](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/273227/lost-japan-by-kerr-alex/9780141979755) *Alex Kerr is a gaijin living in Japan who despairs at the loss of culture in the name of progress, and who also works to restore old buildings in various parts of Japan.*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*
- [Endless Loop: The History of the BASIC Programming Language (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)](https://www.amazon.com/Endless-Loop-Programming-All-purpose-Instruction/dp/1974277070) *It's just fun.*

***Stuck in Progress***

- [The Confusion](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-confusion/id360608725) *This one might take the rest of my life to get through. It's very enjoyable, but Neal Stephenson never met a detail he didn't love to throw in as a 15 page aside.*

### Movies and TV

- [Cold Pursuit](https://www.netflix.com/title/81079733) *This is a stupid movie and you shouldn't watch it. Still, it was not bad for a late night, half-asleep viewing, watching bad people get killed. More bad people should probably get killed.*
- [The Last of Us](https://www.hbo.com/the-last-of-us) *Human fungal infections are on the rise, so this hits a little too close to home, maybe, but I'm kind of enjoying it. I'm watching this **super** slowly.*

***Recently Finished***

- [My Neighbor Totoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro) *Rewatched this again for my daughter's birthday. So good. We watched it in Japanese, of course, because, hey, I speak it, and she's in her second quarter of Japanese class. It's a lot of fun talking about the use of language and the subtitles vs. the original script.*
- [The Wind Rises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises) *Legend*
- [For All Mankind](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/for-all-mankind/umc.cmc.6wsi780sz5tdbqcf11k76mkp7) *Another great one from Apple TV+*
- [Monarch: Legacy of Monsters](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/monarch-legacy-of-monsters/umc.cmc.62l8x0ixrhyq3yaqa5y8yo7ew) *I'm sticking with it, even though the quality is a little up and down.*
- [Slow Horses](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/slow-horses/umc.cmc.2szz3fdt71tl1ulnbp8utgq5o) *Top.Notch.TV.*
- [Godzilla Minus One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_Minus_One) *This is better than anything the Monsterverse has given us. You will feel the feels. So many layers, and I'm not talking about scales on a giant lizard.*

### Food and Drink

- [MENU | Mochinut](https://www.mochinut.com/donut-menu) Mochinut Matcha donuts!!
- [Caffe Del Sol | Espresso Blend | Caffe Vita Coffee Roasting Co.](https://www.caffevita.com/products/caffe-del-sol)

### Projects

- Creating a wiki site for myself for links and topic notes. I also would like to create a private home wiki for my family, inspired by [Jason](https://grepjason.sh) of [Hemispheric Views Podcast](https://hemisphericviews.com/).
- Trying to come up with a light theme that I actually like for my own site. Blue. There has to be blue.

***Recently Finished***

- Learning all about customizing QMK keyboards with [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/)

### Fitness

- Yoga
- Running
- Cycling
- HIIT
- Body weight and core exercises

I'm really going back to longer runs and bike rides again after a period of much needed variation and focus on HIIT and body weight exercises. Yoga is always a constant. I do some yoga almost daily.

### Family

- Trying to get two cats to tolerate each other. It's taking forever. Don't expect this section to change for 6 or 7 years.
