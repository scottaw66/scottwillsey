### Movies

[<span hidden>Havoc • 2025 • Gareth Evans • I made it 5 minutes into this movie and shut it off. It's that stupid. I don't know if this is intentionally dumb, parody style, or if it's unconsciously dumb. Either way, it IS dumb. • Didn't Like It</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>The Four Seasons • 2025 • I say this a lot, but this time it's true - this may be the tv show (limited series) I enjoyed most this year. It's hilarious and poignant. A wonderful remake of Alan Alda's classic. • Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>Dope Thief S1 • 2025 • I can't decided how l'd rate this overall, because it does have some slow moving points and a couple glaring weaknesses. But it's also one of the shows I look forward to the most. So... I guess I love it? • Loved It!</span>
