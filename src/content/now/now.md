### Books

- [BOOK 2, REMEMBRANCE OF EARTH'S PAST › The Dark Forest Cixin Liu & Joel Martinsen >](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-dark-forest/id961788941) *Book 2 in the Three Body Problem series. As long as I can keep track of the characters, I'm looking forward to this because I've never read any of this one before. I don't think anything from this book was in season 1 of 3 Body Problem on Netflix, which is also good news for me.*

### Movies and TV

- [Dawn of the Planet of the Apes](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes/umc.cmc.3dy1jl53vywuuiuh6i8c6cvia) *Second in the trilogy, my daughter and I started watching this together after finishing the first one.*
- [Rise of the Planet of the Apes](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes/umc.cmc.5hrbuszplmwv9me5n799kcd0z) *A recent episode of The Incomparable inspired me to revisit this trilogy (see Podcasts section above) and I'm glad it did. This will be an opportunity for me to watch these with my daughter. The real message of these movies for me is all living things just want to live and have a place they can be home and feel safe.*
