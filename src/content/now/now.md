## Current Personal Status

My daughter started college so that should tell you how old I feel. Fortunately she's still living here. She could live with us forever and I'd be fine with it, personally.

And I'm back to digging up the roots of our cursed, ever-living Empress tree. Never, ever, EVER put one of these in your yard.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Books

[<span hidden>Fluke • 2025 • Brian Klaas • (In progress) You'd thinking finding out everything is random and our smallest choices and actions can change everything would be scary and depressing, but in fact this book is interesting and though provoking and not at all depressing. That sounds like I’m just tolerating it, but I’m in fact enjoying it quite a bit. • Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>To Say Nothing of the Dog • 2013 • Connie Willis • Book 3 of the Oxford Time Travel series. It's funny and cute and compelling, even if I miss Mr. Dunworthy's constant presence ala Doomsday Book. But Ned Henry and all the other characters make this a fun book that's hard to put down. • Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Kandahar • 2023 • Ric Roman Waugh • Not bad, not stupendous, but it was perfect for late night before sleep. Navid Negahban ("Mo") and Bahador Foladi (Farzad) were the most compellingly played characters for me. • Liked It</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Black Rabbit • 2025 • It's hard to like the two main characters in this show, but they do become sympathetic characters over time. There's plenty of tension, action, and family dynamics to go around. Some people are bad for themselves and everyone around them. • Liked It</span>
