## Current Personal Status

I've made some tweaks to my site update scripts and my site build scripts. Everything automatically uploads to my server upon site build now, and the update scripts for various media histories on this /now page directly edit the /now page so there's even less for me to do now. Also, I can generate little thumbnails for food related links now.

If you want to collaborate on any writing projects along the lines of things I write on this site, or if you want to inquire about IT/Computing services for your small to medium-sized business, get in touch on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@scottwillsey) or [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/scottwillsey.com)! I'm open for work possibilities.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>My Father, the BTK Killer • 2025 • Skye Borgman • I think I'Il blame all the annoying dreams I had last night on watching this before going to sleep. I do have a ton of sympathy for Kerri Rawson. She didn't deserve the terrible father she had nor the terrible online abuse she subsequently endured just because she was trying to work it all out. • Decent</span>

[<span hidden>Dark Winds • 2022 • Season 3 - Just starting Season 3. I think this series has evolved from a "must watch" to "there are things I like about it, and I'll get to it when and if I have time" show for me. There's a funny couple cameos in S3E1 though. • Liked It</span>
