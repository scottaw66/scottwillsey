## Current Personal Status
>
> AI is a tool and I don't understand how people become obsessed with their AI "friend". I don't even like it when I ask a question about a couple Python modules and it answers and then follows up with "What are you building?" Hey, if you need to know, I will tell you, ok?

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Movies

[<span hidden>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy • 2011 • Tomas Alfredson • They don't make many movies like this anymore. Both intelligently written and yet not overly- wrought with twists and surprises, it's a subtly played movie staring Gary Oldman at his best, but with a stellar cast in general. Highly recommended. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Sean Combs: The Reckoning • 2025 • I kind of watched this like you'd watch any train wreck, but truly it is interesting. 50 Cent should be given props for deciding to go all in on showing what a terrible human being Combs is. • Liked It</span>

### Music
