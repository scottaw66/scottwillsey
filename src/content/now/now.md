## Current Personal Status

I have a lot of thoughts about AI that I should write up at some point, regarding my own stance on using AI, what it's good for, what it's NOT good for, and how I can justify its use given the many valid concerns about the Silicon Valley companies making these models, the environmental effects of the "scale forever" approach to LLMs, and all the other disturbing parts of modern Silicon Valley (hint: a lot of it relates to venture capitalism and capitalism in general).

I know a lot of people are going to get mad immediately, and I think I alienated some people in the MacStories discord that I didn't mean to because I'm not staunchly anti-AI, but it's very hard to have these conversations in text without people seeing what they want to see in whatever you say. For the record, Federico Viticci and John Voorhees of MacStories themselves have been (in my opinion) very pragmatic and open-minded on the topic. They've denounced that "artistic" and content-creation uses of AI as well as the problems to society, while also being pragmatic about the things that it is good for. This is very much inline with my views on the topic.

Anyway... my track record of accidentally alienating people online continues.

### Books

[<span hidden>Buried in the Sky • 2012 • Climbers are nuts. People keep dying on these peaks in really unnecessary ways and it very often seems like the result of the most idiotic decisions on the part of people who are supposed to be experienced. Really gripping tale. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Pluribus • 2025 • In progress. I honestly didn't know what to think of this for about 1 and a half episodes, but wow, has it got me hooked now. Rhea Seehorn is always amazing and Karolina Wydra is perfect in her unsettling role as Zosia. • Loved It!</span>
