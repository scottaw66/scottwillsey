## Current Personal Status

In recent episodes of [Friends with Brews](https://friendswithbrews.com) I've been using the [Riverside](https://riverside.com) combined audio and editing it there to produce the shows, but for [ep 93](https://friendswithbrews.com/93/) I used both of our audio tracks and edited everything in Logic Pro again. The result is the best sounding episode in a long time, audio quality-wise.

I also have to say that the [Izotope RX 11](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx.html) Dialogue Isolate plugin does a really nice job. I'm pretty impressed with it.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Books

[<span hidden>Buried in the Sky • 2012 • Climbers are nuts. People keep dying on these peaks in really unnecessary ways and it very often seems like the result of the most idiotic decisions on the part of people who are supposed to be experienced. Really gripping tale. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Pluribus • 2025 • In progress. I honestly didn't know what to think of this for about 1 and a half episodes, but wow, has it got me hooked now. Rhea Seehorn is always amazing and Karolina Wydra is perfect in her unsettling role as Zosia. • Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>Dark Winds • 2022 • Season 3 - Just starting Season 3. I think this series has evolved from a "must watch" to "there are things I like about it, and I'll get to it when and if I have time" show for me. There's a funny couple cameos in S3E1 though. • Liked It</span>
