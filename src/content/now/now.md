## Current Personal Status

Remember how I thought my 2024 M4 MacBook Pro has a broken Thunderbolt 5 port because it quit recognizing anything plugged into it (including my TB4 hub)? Well, I took it to Apple and when then genius bar employee put it into diag mode, it apparently fixed whatever SOFTWARE issue was causing the problem, because it immediately started working for her, and it's worked for me ever since too.

Oh, Apple. How many times in the past few years has your software driven me to drink?

### Books

[<span hidden>A History of What Comes Next • M Sylvain Neuvel • 2021 • A wonderful historical fiction novel that becomes... sci-fi? Yes, and it's a great premise too. It's not always an easy read, because there is a lot of tension and bad times, but it IS a worthy read. • Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Havoc • 2025 • Gareth Evans • I'm all for a good violent movie now and again, but I'm also a fan of things being basically believable. Also the only likable character here was Ellie, played by Jessie Mei Li. Even Forest Whitaker seemed to be phoning it in for the most part. Not bad if you're working on something while you watch. • Decent</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>The Last Frontier • 2025 • Another Apple TV+ series. Two episodes in, not sure how I'm going to feel about it. Started off well in some ways, hand-wavy in others. Seems like it's worth giving a chance though. • Liked It</span>
