### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. ðŸ˜ž*  

[![Chasing Shadows â€¢ Just started it... the story of Citizen Lab, the world's foremost digital watchdog. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/ChasingShadowsReview-4dbe97f8-0347-4893-86d8-2d9da417e159.png)](/images/posts/ChasingShadowsReview-4dbe97f8-0347-4893-86d8-2d9da417e159.jpg)
[![Fluke â€¢ Just started it, but it's both intellectually interesting and a nice counterpoint to the religion of determinism. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Fluke-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.png)](/images/posts/Fluke-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.jpg)

### Movies

[![Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief â€¢ 2015 â€¢ Alex Gibney Scientology is weird. Ron Hubbard was weird and evil. David Miscavige is just plain evil. An interesting documentary about a rotten church. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4B5BB133Ca0-review-a10625ab-89dc-4214-a9f7-96ab31198f8c.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4B5BB133Ca0-review-a10625ab-89dc-4214-a9f7-96ab31198f8c.jpg)
[![To Live and Die in L.A. 1985 â€¢ William Friedkin â€¢ Not as good as I remembered. Everyone in this is evil, or an idiot. I didn't buy the transformation of John Vukovich. He didn't earn it. Dafoe is stellar, of course. â€¢ Decent](../../assets/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.png)](/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.jpg)

### TV Shows

[![The Studio â€¢ 2025 â€¢ *This is a review of S1E1 only!* Yeah, I don't know. Doesn't the world have enough selfish, dishonest people? â€¢ Decent](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage46C597C4930-review-0deb2247-4477-4a69-a713-be80dc9f454a.png)](/images/posts/PngImage46C597C4930-review-0deb2247-4477-4a69-a713-be80dc9f454a.jpg)
[![Severance S1&2 â€¢ 2022 â€¢ Man, this thing is weird and wild but also so much deeper than you might think at first. One of the best shows ever. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage42999A84080-review-6126286a-a138-4551-8892-ad278b0bfa5f.png)](/images/posts/PngImage42999A84080-review-6126286a-a138-4551-8892-ad278b0bfa5f.jpg)
[![Prime Target â€¢ 2025 â€¢ S1 review: Started off pretty good, then devolved into complete implausible nonsense. Very disappointing. â€¢ Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4958Bb09820-review-537f7b28-8d4a-4f6a-a3f5-10e682af7b61.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4958Bb09820-review-537f7b28-8d4a-4f6a-a3f5-10e682af7b61.jpg)

### Music

[![Magic Monkey â€¢ Godiego â€¢ 1980 â€¢ A childhood favorite from when I lived in Kagoshima, Japan. Apparently Apple Music has heard of Godiego, so hey!
