[<span hidden>Things Become Other Things • 2025 • Craig Mod Craig has been wandering Japan on foot for decades, photographing and talking and observing, and he does brings the experience to life in a very spiritual way. He brings to life the importance of caring about things in the way that modern techno-fascist ideologies do exactly the opposite of. I'm hooked and trying to keep from racing through this. • Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Havoc • 2025 • Gareth Evans • I made it 5 minutes into this movie and shut it off. It's that stupid. I don't know if this is intentionally dumb, parody style, or if it's unconsciously dumb. Either way, it IS dumb. • Didn't Like It</span>
