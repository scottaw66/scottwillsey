## Current Personal Status

> Every now and then I prove to myself that I still have weak spots in my approach to life and other humans. Well, you can't have opportunity for growth without "opportunity". 😄 On the plus side, I have a nice little Sophos XGS 88 to play with at home now for testing and configuring Sophos FW with.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Movies

[<span hidden>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy • 2011 • Tomas Alfredson • They don't make many movies like this anymore. Both intelligently written and yet not overly- wrought with twists and surprises, it's a subtly played movie staring Gary Oldman at his best, but with a stellar cast in general. Highly recommended. • Loved It!</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Pluribus • 2025 • In progress. I honestly didn't know what to think of this for about 1 and a half episodes, but wow, has it got me hooked now. Rhea Seehorn is always amazing and Karolina Wydra is perfect in her unsettling role as Zosia. • Loved It!</span>
