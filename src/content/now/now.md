### Books

- [BOOK 2, REMEMBRANCE OF EARTH'S PAST › The Dark Forest Cixin Liu & Joel Martinsen >](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-dark-forest/id961788941) *Book 2 in the Three Body Problem series. As long as I can keep track of the characters, I'm looking forward to this because I've never read any of this one before. I don't think anything from this book was in season 1 of 3 Body Problem on Netflix, which is also good news for me.*

- [Personal Days – Ed Park](https://ed-park.com/personal-days/) *Beautiful and horrible all at once. It's kind of genius - but it will depress the @#%& out of you if you're in the working world (we all are).*

### Movies and TV

- [Rise of the Planet of the Apes](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes/umc.cmc.5hrbuszplmwv9me5n799kcd0z) *A recent episode of The Incomparable inspired me to revisit this trilogy (see Podcasts section above) and I'm glad it did. This will be an opportunity for me to watch these with my daughter. The real message of these movies for me is all living things just want to live and have a place they can be home and feel safe.*

- [Sunny](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/sunny/umc.cmc.7c5t9dde8dxoaxwyl5rkuw38p) *This is a wild series. It also has enough Japanese dialogue to be fun to listen to. I don't know where it's going, but so far I'm onboard. I just hope they don't drag it on too long before things progress because it feels like it could be very simplistic and just kept mysterious by not revealing anything anytime soon, or it could be really intricate and entertaining.*
