### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. ðŸ˜ž*

- [Leave the World Behind](https://books.apple.com/us/book/leave-the-world-behind/id1493825355) *FINISHED. I'm not going to lie â€“ I didn't like this book. What's happening is never fully resolved, but if it's what the book implies, there's no way it would have been this relatively easy for the characters in the book. None of how this happened would have happened that way. I know it's popular, but the writing style and the ambiguity didn't really suit me.*
- [Polostan â€“ Volume One of Bomb Light](https://books.apple.com/us/book/polostan/id6474502267) *FINISHED - a good start to a new Neal Stephenson series, with lots of the usual info-dumps that somehow are fun coming from him.*
- [Guerrilla Marketing in 30 Days](https://books.apple.com/us/book/guerrilla-marketing-in-30-days/id843779604) *Marketing. I can't do it.*
- [Build, Run, and Sell Your Apple Consulting Practice: Business and Marketing for iOS and Mac Start Ups | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-3835-6) *This book is by Charles Edge, much missed MacAdmins guru. The lessons in here are applicable to consulting in general.*

### Movies

- [Sicario: Day of the Soldado](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/400535-sicario-day-of-the-soldado-2018) *I liked the first one with Emily Blunt as the fish out of water much better, but this is a pretty good movie. It's weird that Graver and Gillick seem to be redeemed here, as though their crimes and corrupt personas in the 2015 Sicario weren't really them. ðŸ¤·*
- [Pain Hustlers](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862968-pain-hustlers-2023) *Quirky, funny, depressing. Recommended.*
- [Bad Boys: Ride or Die](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/573435-bad-boys-ride-or-die-2024) *I knew it would be horrible, and it did not disappoint.*
- [War for the Planet of the Apes](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/281338-war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-2017) *Best ever. Seriously, it is a really good movie.*
- [Wolfs](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/877817-wolfs-2024) *Two guys past the point where their charm overcomes a lame script, but it could have been worse, possibly.*

### TV Shows

- [Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn Season 1 Episode 2 â€“ Chapter 2: Hostage Justice](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/231319-wanted-the-escape-of-carlos-ghosn/season/1/episode/2) *I always kind of assumed Ghosn was the criminal he was accused of being, but now I think at the very least Nissan wanted him gone and created this investigation to achieve that.*
- [Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn Season 1 Episode 1 â€“ Chapter 1: Hubris](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/231319-wanted-the-escape-of-carlos-ghosn/season/1/episode/1)
- [Shrinking Season 2 Episode 4 â€“ Made You Look](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/136311-shrinking/season/2/episode/4) *Shrinking is slightly annoying at times with how much everyone is a character with super witty banter because there aren't THAT many witty characters in one or two overlapping social circles, but it is a good show.*
- [Silo Season 1 Episode 10 â€“ Outside](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/125988-silo/season/1/episode/10) *Someone told me the TV adaptation of Silo was good but not great, but I thought it was great, not good. Very enjoyable.*
- [This Is the Zodiac Speaking Season 1 Episode 3 â€“ Box of Secrets](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/272299-this-is-the-zodiac-speaking/season/1/episode/3) *It's a little weird, but if I had to bet on one guy being Zodiak, it would be this guy.*
- [This Is the Zodiac Speaking Season 1 Episode 2 â€“ Are You the Zodiac?](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/272299-this-is-the-zodiac-speaking/season/1/episode/2)

### Projects

- **trakt-history-py**

Python version of Trakt history grabber for updating my [/now](https://scottwillsey.com/now/) page. I want to be able to grab my trakt history and format it for the Movies and TV section of this /now page using a Raycast Script Command. I don't update trakt directly, rather I am using the excellent [Sequel app](https://www.getsequel.app) to track shows and movies (and also books).

It now internally incorporates the parts of [pytrakt3000](https://github.com/scottaw66/pytrakt3000) that I'm actually using and doesn't need to import it any longer, so it's now a standalone utility.

*[https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py)*

- **pytrakt3000: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API**

This is a fork of [glensc/python-pytrakt: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API](https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt) and is a module for using the Trakt API. My [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) utility mentioned above used to import and use this.

*I'm no longer actually using this as I incorporated the parts I was using into [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) itself.*
