## Current Personal Status
>
> I'm not a huge fan of what the US is becoming. You should not have to occupy your own cities unless you're afraid of something that you yourself have caused. Have the courage to allow people to be free again.

## Current Projects

- Japanese and Korean study (somewhat proficient in J, complete newb to K)

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>The Convenience Store by the Sea • First Time Read • 2020 • Sonoko Machida • I didn't know what to think of this book initially. It felt slightly stilted, whether due to translation or not, I'm not sure. But I kept reading. And it started drawing me in by brilliantly building intertwined moments of social interactions and vignettes of character development. • Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>Grid to Glory • 2025 • Alex Jacques • Alex Jacques is one of my favorite F1 commentators. His personality shines, and he's clearly a hard worker who knows what he's doing. The stories he's chosen for this book are compelling, but the writing style pulls me out of them. He uses sentence fragments instead of commas, and sometimes the background explanations are slightly muddled. Good, not great. • Decent</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>The Perfect Neighbor • First Time Watch • 2025 • Geeta Gandbhir • You kind of have to be into crime documentaries to like this, but the real takeaway here is how stupid Stand Your Ground laws and the people who think they're a good idea are.
