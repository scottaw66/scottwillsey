## Current Personal Status
>
> Work was fun this week. Whatever's going on with my body isn't. However, I have vastly improved my sleep quality by getting rid of the big traditional American bed and going to the floor with a futon. Wow! When I wake up I feel like I actually SLEPT through the night in a way I haven't in a long time.

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Books

[<span hidden>Buried in the Sky • 2012 • Climbers are nuts. People keep dying on these peaks in really unnecessary ways and it very often seems like the result of the most idiotic decisions on the part of people who are supposed to be experienced. Really gripping tale. • Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy • 2011 • Tomas Alfredson • They don't make many movies like this anymore. Both intelligently written and yet not overly- wrought with twists and surprises, it's a subtly played movie staring Gary Oldman at his best, but with a stellar cast in general. Highly recommended. • Loved It!</span>
