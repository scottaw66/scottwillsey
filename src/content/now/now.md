### Books

- [Kingdom of Play | Book by David Toomey | Official Publisher Page | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kingdom-of-Play/David-Toomey/9781982154462) *This is a pretty fascinating look at an under-studied element of animal life – the fact that animals play. But why? How does play benefit animals trying to survive in the ruthless foodchain that is their lives?*
- [Hacking with macOS – learn to make macOS apps with Swift 5.10 using real-world projects](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-macos) *It should be pretty obvious what this one is about.*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*
