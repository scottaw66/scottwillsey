### Books

[<span hidden>Fluke â€¢ 2025 â€¢ Brian Klaas â€¢ (In progress) You'd thinking finding out everything is random and our smallest choices and actions can change everything would be scary and depressing, but in fact this book is interesting and though provoking and not at all depressing. That sounds like Iâ€™m just tolerating it, but Iâ€™m in fact enjoying it quite a bit. â€¢ Loved It!</span>

[<span hidden>To Say Nothing of the Dog â€¢ 2013 â€¢ Connie Willis â€¢ Book 3 of the Oxford Time Travel series. It's funny and cute and compelling, even if I miss Mr. Dunworthy's constant presence ala Doomsday Book. But Ned Henry and all the other characters make this a fun book that's hard to put down. â€¢ Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Kandahar â€¢ 2023 â€¢ Ric Roman Waugh â€¢ Not bad, not stupendous, but it was perfect for late night before sleep. Navid Negahban ("Mo") and Bahador Foladi (Farzad) were the most compellingly played characters for me. â€¢ Liked It</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>Dark Winds Season 2 â€¢ 2022 â€¢ At the beginning of S2, I thought it was going to be a letdown. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The actors all live their characters very well, and I hope S3 comes to Netflix soon. â€¢ Loved It!</span>
