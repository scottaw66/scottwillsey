- Revamping this site's [Uses](https://scottwillsey.com/uses/) page.

### Fitness

- Yoga
- Running
- Cycling
- HIIT
- Body weight and core exercises

I'm really going back to longer runs and bike rides again after a period of much needed variation and focus on HIIT and body weight exercises. Yoga is always a constant. I do some yoga almost daily.
