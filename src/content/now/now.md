## Current Personal Status

You may have gotten the impression that I've dramatically slowed the pace on both posting here and posting podcasts at [Friends with Brews](https://friendswithbrews.com). That's because itt's true, I have. I have really had to prioritize work and family things, and frankly I sometimes just want to get away from the computer. But I have some plans for projects still, as well as getting back to this site and Friends with Brews.

They aren't dead yet!!

## Stuff I've recently enjoyed

### Books

[<span hidden>A History of What Comes Next • M Sylvain Neuvel • 2021 • A wonderful historical fiction novel that becomes... sci-fi? Yes, and it's a great premise too. It's not always an easy read, because there is a lot of tension and bad times, but it IS a worthy read. • Loved It!</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Havoc • 2025 • Gareth Evans • I'm all for a good violent movie now and again, but I'm also a fan of things being basically believable. Also the only likable character here was Ellie, played by Jessie Mei Li. Even Forest Whitaker seemed to be phoning it in for the most part. Not bad if you're working on something while you watch. • Decent</span>

### TV Shows

[<span hidden>The Last Frontier • 2025 • Another Apple TV+ series. Two episodes in, not sure how I'm going to feel about it. Started off well in some ways, hand-wavy in others. Seems like it's worth giving a chance though. • Liked It</span>
