### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. ðŸ˜ž*

- [Starter Villain](https://books.apple.com/us/book/starter-villain/id6443361997) *I'm about halfway into this, and it is a fun read â€“ not deep, not substantial, but fun. I'd probably wither and die on a steady diet of books like this, but it's a great change of pace and, unusually, is full of likable characters.*

### Projects

- **trakt-history-py**

Python version of Trakt history grabber for updating my [/now](https://scottwillsey.com/now/) page. I want to be able to grab my trakt history and format it for the Movies and TV section of this /now page using a Raycast Script Command. I don't update trakt directly, rather I am using the excellent [Sequel app](https://www.getsequel.app) to track shows and movies (and also books).

It now internally incorporates the parts of [pytrakt3000](https://github.com/scottaw66/pytrakt3000) that I'm actually using and doesn't need to import it any longer, so it's now a standalone utility.
