### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. ðŸ˜ž*  

[![Chasing Shadows Just started it... the story of Citizen Lab, the world's foremost digital watchdog. Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/ChasingShadowsReview-4dbe97f8-0347-4893-86d8-2d9da417e159.png)](/images/posts/ChasingShadowsReview-4dbe97f8-0347-4893-86d8-2d9da417e159.jpg)

### Movies

[![To Live and Die in L.A. 1985 â€¢ William Friedkin â€¢ Not as good as I remembered. Everyone in this is evil, or an idiot. I didn't buy the transformation of John Vukovich. He didn't earn it. Dafoe is stellar, of course. Decent](../../assets/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.png)](/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.jpg)
[![The Princess Bride 1987 â€¢ Rob Reiner â€¢ A multiple rewatch, of course, but one of the greatest movies ever. So many classic lines and characters. Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/ThePrincessBrideReview-be189bc8-20cc-44eb-b5c6-3a39d917defb.png)](/images/posts/ThePrincessBrideReview-be189bc8-20cc-44eb-b5c6-3a39d917defb.jpg)

### TV Shows

[![Vietnam: The War That Changed America 2025 Overall, very well done - depressing, uplifting, maddening, inspiring, and insightful either way. I think some of the things chosen to focus on were a bit off, but mostly they nailed it. Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4E32Ad42D80-review-af9dd394-2bff-4e5b-8f59-771f03a2bf41.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4E32Ad42D80-review-af9dd394-2bff-4e5b-8f59-771f03a2bf41.jpg)
[![Senna 2024 Senna's story is compelling but this series failed to capture Fl racing in a realistic way. Don't recommend for anyone who actually knows Fl or the Senna story already. Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.png)](/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.jpg)
[![Surviving Black Hawk Down Everyone knows the Black Hawk Down story - here are some people who were there. A good documentary, with views from all sides. It was two terrible days that never should have happened. Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/SurvivingBlackHawkDownReview-a6d3b952-df30-4f46-b9d7-845e7b6a3fce.png)](/images/posts/SurvivingBlackHawkDownReview-a6d3b952-df30-4f46-b9d7-845e7b6a3fce.jpg)
[![Mr Inbetween 2018 Finished all 3 seasons, and apparently | *HAD* watched the whole thing. But it's good enough to watch again. And probably again. Great show! Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/MrInbetweenReview-7ee14a41-5583-4682-8738-833a6761ec40.png)](/images/posts/MrInbetweenReview-7ee14a41-5583-4682-8738-833a6761ec40.jpg)
