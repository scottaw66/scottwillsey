### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. üòû*

- [The Man Who Lied to His Laptop ‚Äî Clifford Nass & Corina Yen](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-man-who-lied-to-his-laptop/id385166427) *This is not a novel, but it **IS** a novel look at how people interact with and anthropomorphize technology.*
- [Kingdom of Play | Book by David Toomey | Official Publisher Page | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kingdom-of-Play/David-Toomey/9781982154462) *This is a fascinating look at an under-studied element of animal life ‚Äì the fact that animals play (and dream). But why? How does play benefit animals trying to survive in the ruthless foodchain that is their lives?*
- [BOOK 2, REMEMBRANCE OF EARTH'S PAST ‚Ä∫ The Dark Forest Cixin Liu & Joel Martinsen](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-dark-forest/id961788941) *Book 2 in the Three Body Problem series. As long as I can keep track of the characters, I'm looking forward to this because I've never read any of this one before. I don't think anything from this book was in season 1 of 3 Body Problem on Netflix, which is also good news for me.*

### Movies and TV

- [Monsieur Spade](https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81788695) *Clive Owen is always great. And cranky characters who secretly care deeply about people are too. This has both!*  
- [The Night Manager](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B01EIM5NGG/) *I'm very late to this adaptation of John le Carr√©'s 1993 novel of the same name, but wow, is it worth a watch. Great acting. Of course Hugh Laurie is always top notch, but don't miss Tom Hiddleston here. You may think of him as Loki now, but the man has range and depth.*
- [Bad Monkey - Eps 1-4](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/bad-monkey/umc.cmc.2qoep59s6qukjonprttysfs8x) *I don't consider myself the HUGEST of Vince Vaughn fans, but he's really good in this Yet Another Down On His Luck Detective show that has managed a few interesting twists in just its first four episodes.*
