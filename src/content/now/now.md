### Projects

- **trakt-history-py**

Python version of Trakt history grabber for updating my [/now](https://scottwillsey.com/now/) page. I want to be able to grab my trakt history and format it for the Movies and TV section of this /now page using a Raycast Script Command. I don't update trakt directly, rather I am using the excellent [Sequel app](https://www.getsequel.app) to track shows and movies (and also books).

It now internally incorporates the parts of [pytrakt3000](https://github.com/scottaw66/pytrakt3000) that I'm actually using and doesn't need to import it any longer, so it's now a standalone utility.

*[https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py)*

- **pytrakt3000: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API**

This is a fork of [glensc/python-pytrakt: A Pythonic interface to the Trakt.tv REST API](https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt) and is a module for using the Trakt API. My [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) utility mentioned above used to import and use this.

*I'm no longer actually using this as I incorporated the parts I was using into [trakt-history-py](https://github.com/scottaw66/trakt-history-py) itself.*
