### Current Personal Status

**2025-06-15 – 2025-06-30**

I have the joy of touring Japan with my daughter for two weeks, revisiting places I lived in Japan as a boy (Karuizawa and Kagoshima), as well as Tokyo and Kyoto. I will have a photos site to share photos from the trip on after I get home.

Some of the highlights so far have been:

- Visiting the old house I lived in in Karuizawa, and generally enjoying the beautiful weather and scenery there.
- Visiting Kagoshima, eating some amazing food there (they have the best food in Japan, in my opinion), and riding the ferry to Sakurajima, the active volcano that overlooks the city.
- Enjoying the chaos of Tokyo Asakusa, and visiting the Senso-ji temple, as well as Shibuya and Harajuku.
- Spending time in some lesser known temples and bamboo groves in Kyoto. Also the city was nice and the food was outstanding.

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*
