### Books

- [Personal Days – Ed Park](https://ed-park.com/personal-days/) *Beautiful and horrible all at once. It's kind of genius - but it will depress the @#%& out of you if you're in the working world (we all are).*

- [The Three-Body Problem - Tor Publishing Group](https://torpublishinggroup.com/the-three-body-problem/) *I FINALLY FINISHED THIS BOOK!! I think in most ways, it's better than the 3 Body Problem TV show on Netflix. But I'm not 100% sure I enjoyed either enough to recommend them at this point. That's a reverse on what I told Peter on [Friends with Brews](https://friendswithbrews.com), when I told him to watch the Netflix series, but it's how I feel at the momement.*

### Movies and TV

- [Your Honor - Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81684531) *Bryan Cranston is always at his best when he's trying to clean up his own messes. I know I'll get slammed for this but I actually compare this to The Wire.*
