### YouTube

Hey look, a YouTube section! I do use YouTube a lot to catch up on tech information or just to watch all the things people did wrong on Mt Everest right before they died, but YouTube is such a click-bait generator that it does require some care and ignoring 99% of what YouTube recommends.

### Books

**I'm progressing slowly here, but I actually am still reading these books.**  

I don't have a lot of time for reading these days, and usually by the time I get in bed I'm too tired to think so I just play solitaire or crosswords or Lex.games and then go to sleep. But I am reading these!

- [The Three-Body Problem - Tor Publishing Group](https://torpublishinggroup.com/the-three-body-problem/) *I've actually read this once, but it was a long time ago and since then I've seen season 1 of Netflix' 3 Body Problem. So review time it is. I also have the 2nd book in the series, The Dark Forest, which I plan to make it to by finishing this one first.*
- [Kingdom of Play | Book by David Toomey | Official Publisher Page | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kingdom-of-Play/David-Toomey/9781982154462) *This is a pretty fascinating look at an under-studied element of animal life – the fact that animals play. But why? How does play benefit animals trying to survive in the ruthless foodchain that is their lives? I rented this from the library and now I'm waiting for it again (didn't finish in time).*
- [Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data by Micah Lee](https://hacksandleaks.com/) *This is more technical manual than history or novel, but it is **fascinating**. It's really a how-to of sensitive data analysis.*

### Movies and TV

- [Your Honor - Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81684531) *Bryan Cranston is always at his best when he's trying to clean up his own messes. I'm only 4 episodes in, but I will watch this whole thing for sure.*
- [The Town](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/23168) *Greatest movie ever? Most definitely not. But I did enjoy it at 1 am after a week of work.*
- [Dark Matter](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/dark-matter/umc.cmc.4luj45vtqpmjsvb6sc2675oeg) *It took EIGHT @#$@# EPISODES TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING, but now I pretty much have to watch to see how the protagonist(s) resolves this mess.*

### Food and Drink

- [ETHIOPIA – DOMA Coffee Roasting Company](https://www.domacoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/ethiopia) *I need a couple more brews of this to decide how much I like it, but it's certainly inoffensive.*
- [Toshi Restaurant](https://toshirestaurant.wixsite.com/beaverton) *This place has wonderful hot donburi, curry, and ramen, but the fresh sushi is worth its weight in gold (and costs it too).*
- [Home | ramen-ryoma](https://www.ramenryoma.net/) *You can get really good ramen here for a family without bankrupting yourself, and that's not nothing. In fact, it's quite something. You should go. Now. Today.*
