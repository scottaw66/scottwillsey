### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. ðŸ˜ž*  

[![Chasing Shadows â€¢ Just started it... the story of Citizen Lab, the world's foremost digital watchdog. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/ChasingShadowsReview-4dbe97f8-0347-4893-86d8-2d9da417e159.png)](/images/posts/ChasingShadowsReview-4dbe97f8-0347-4893-86d8-2d9da417e159.jpg)
[![Fluke â€¢ Just started it, but it's both intellectually interesting and a nice counterpoint to the religion of determinism. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Fluke-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.png)](/images/posts/Fluke-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.jpg)
[![The Silo Series Collection â€¢ One of the best dystopian series ever written. Kind of hard to read in early 2025 though. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Silo-Series-Collection-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.png)](/images/posts/Silo-Series-Collection-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.jpg)

### Movies

[![To Live and Die in L.A. 1985 â€¢ William Friedkin â€¢ Not as good as I remembered. Everyone in this is evil, or an idiot. I didn't buy the transformation of John Vukovich. He didn't earn it. Dafoe is stellar, of course. Decent](../../assets/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.png)](/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.jpg)
[![The Princess Bride 1987 â€¢ Rob Reiner â€¢ A multiple rewatch, of course, but one of the greatest movies ever. So many classic lines and characters. â€¢ Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/ThePrincessBrideReview-be189bc8-20cc-44eb-b5c6-3a39d917defb.png)](/images/posts/ThePrincessBrideReview-be189bc8-20cc-44eb-b5c6-3a39d917defb.jpg)

### TV Shows

[![Formula 1: Drive to Survive â€¢ 2019 â€¢ Season 7 of Drive to Survive is certainly the only season I'd rate this highly. FINALLY they quit manufacturing stories that barely existed and largely abandoned the constant chronological jumps. Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4E2CBff0500-review-213b7ece-93b3-4e7c-8014-eea56f9e2ce4.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4E2CBff0500-review-213b7ece-93b3-4e7c-8014-eea56f9e2ce4.jpg)
[![American Murder: Gabby Petito â€¢ 2025 â€¢ A very well done documentary on an age old problem. Depressing but also uplifting at times. Don't watch if you're not in a good place. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage40C6A17DB10-review-cc7cc661-18f8-4d71-ac1f-d67b5a7af69b.png)](/images/posts/PngImage40C6A17DB10-review-cc7cc661-18f8-4d71-ac1f-d67b5a7af69b.jpg)
[![Vietnam: The War That Changed America â€¢ 2025 â€¢ Overall, very well done - depressing, uplifting, maddening, inspiring, and insightful either way. I think some of the things chosen to focus on were a bit off, but mostly they nailed it. â€¢ Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4E32Ad42D80-review-af9dd394-2bff-4e5b-8f59-771f03a2bf41.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4E32Ad42D80-review-af9dd394-2bff-4e5b-8f59-771f03a2bf41.jpg)
[![Senna â€¢ 2024 â€¢ Senna's story is compelling but this series failed to capture Fl racing in a realistic way. Don't recommend for anyone who actually knows Fl or the Senna story already. â€¢ Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.png)](/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.jpg)
