## Current Personal Status
>
> This week I feel overwhelmed with all the things I need and want to get done. I could easily just sleep all day most days, and I'm not sure what that's all about, but I have goals that I want to make progress on, so I'm not taking those naps that I want so much. No. Not happening.

> I do wish I was a cat though.
