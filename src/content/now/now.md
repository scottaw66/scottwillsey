### Current Personal Status

Trying to get some work done, and also vibe coding myself a Mac app for time tracking using Claude Code with Opus 4.1. Hey, I need the app.

### Podcasts

*Podcast episodes without links are members-only but I think are interesting enough to post in case you want to investigate them.*

### Books

[<span hidden>Sir Lewis • 2025 • Michael Sawyer Look. Lewis is an actual role model, and he's also a true legend. This book was just a little too willing to bypass nuances in a couple cases and overstate its case. It did not need to do that, because Lewis' life and work speaks for itself. • Liked It</span>

### Movies

[<span hidden>Ballerina • 2025 • Len Wiseman • Sometimes you just want to see people get shot and stabbed, and this is a lot of fun for that. John Wick movies always have interesting choreography and fights. Ana de Armas is fine as Eve and the action is all very well done. • Loved It!</span>
