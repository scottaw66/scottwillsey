### Books

*Don't be surprised when the book list stays constant for awhile. Reading time is harder to come by these days. üòû*

- [Fluke | Book by Brian Klaas | Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Fluke/Brian-Klaas/9781668006535) *Determinists should read this with an open mind.*
- [The Silo Series Collection](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-silo-series-collection/id1602732974) *Even if you're watching the Apple TV+ series, READ THESE! They're different enough that it won't ruin everything, and they're both fun in their own ways. Plus (I don't know if you noticed), reading and watching things are different activities.*
- [Doomsday Book](https://books.apple.com/us/book/doomsday-book/id420427169) *Time travel done right in a very clever and compelling story.*
