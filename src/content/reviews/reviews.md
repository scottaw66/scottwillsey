### Books

[![The Silo Series Collection • One of the best dystopian series ever written. Kind of hard to read in early 2025 though. • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Silo-Series-Collection-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.png)](/images/posts/Silo-Series-Collection-review-3ABD1A95-A382-4EB0-AD9E-B5253755A6BD.jpg)

### Movies

[![To Live and Die in L.A. 1985 • William Friedkin • Not as good as I remembered. Everyone in this is evil, or an idiot. I didn't buy the transformation of John Vukovich. He didn't earn it. Dafoe is stellar, of course. Decent](../../assets/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.png)](/images/posts/ToLiveAndDieInL.A.Review-c431a1c8-0edb-465d-bcd8-f8b33d1de492.jpg)
[![The Princess Bride 1987 • Rob Reiner • A multiple rewatch, of course, but one of the greatest movies ever. So many classic lines and characters. • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/ThePrincessBrideReview-be189bc8-20cc-44eb-b5c6-3a39d917defb.png)](/images/posts/ThePrincessBrideReview-be189bc8-20cc-44eb-b5c6-3a39d917defb.jpg)
[![Small Things Like these • The ending left me with MANY questions, but what an excellent and haunting movie. Cillian Murphy is amazing here and Emily Watson embodies the compassionless preacher of compassion like no other. • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Small-Things-Like-These-review-B7EA41BD-78D5-4E3B-AAD4-BE16300AED91.png)](/images/posts/Small-Things-Like-These-review-B7EA41BD-78D5-4E3B-AAD4-BE16300AED91.jpg)
[![Cold Blood • Jean Reno is always interesting, and Sarah Lind did a good job, but the plot was weird and the ending unsatisfying. • Decent](../../assets/images/posts/Cold-Blood-review-2ECDD41C-4181-4540-9E06-BBA87F1D3EF5.png)](/images/posts/Cold-Blood-review-2ECDD41C-4181-4540-9E06-BBA87F1D3EF5.jpg)
[![Bullet Train • 2022 • David Leitch The couple beers I drank may have helped, but I found this hilarious and fun. • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage48908Df7560-review-fc161232-4836-49b8-8d35-5414af55097c.png)](/images/posts/PngImage48908Df7560-review-fc161232-4836-49b8-8d35-5414af55097c.jpg)
[![Woman of the Hour • 2024 • I don't think I'd recommend it, but Anna Kendrick definitely does her part to make it worthwhile. No one ever believes a woman reporting a crime is the reality. • Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/Woman-of-the-Hour-review-EDA16B3D-1BEE-4437-8504-4487F9BB456B.png)](/images/posts/Woman-of-the-Hour-review-EDA16B3D-1BEE-4437-8504-4487F9BB456B.jpg)
[![The Fall Guy • 2024 • Yeah, I guess it's kind of dumb, but I really enjoyed it. Ryan Gosling is always good as a guy who has terrible things to do and he just gets on and does what has to be done. And Emily Blunt is always completely her character. Great actors, both. • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/The-Fall-Guy-review-EDA16B3D-1BEE-4437-8504-4487F9BB456B.png)](/images/posts/The-Fall-Guy-review-EDA16B3D-1BEE-4437-8504-4487F9BB456B.jpg)
[![Monkey Man • 2024 • Dev Patel • I don't know if I really should have enjoyed it so much, but I was in the mood for it and Dev Patel is a very compelling actor. • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/Monkey-Man-review-EDA16B3D-1BEE-4437-8504-4487F9BB456B.png)](/images/posts/Monkey-Man-review-EDA16B3D-1BEE-4437-8504-4487F9BB456B.jpg)

### TV Shows

[![American Murder: Gabby Petito • 2025 • A very well done documentary on an age old problem. Depressing but also uplifting at times. Don't watch if you're not in a good place. • Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage40C6A17DB10-review-cc7cc661-18f8-4d71-ac1f-d67b5a7af69b.png)](/images/posts/PngImage40C6A17DB10-review-cc7cc661-18f8-4d71-ac1f-d67b5a7af69b.jpg)
[![Vietnam: The War That Changed America • 2025 • Overall, very well done - depressing, uplifting, maddening, inspiring, and insightful either way. I think some of the things chosen to focus on were a bit off, but mostly they nailed it. • Liked It](../../assets/images/posts/PngImage4E32Ad42D80-review-af9dd394-2bff-4e5b-8f59-771f03a2bf41.png)](/images/posts/PngImage4E32Ad42D80-review-af9dd394-2bff-4e5b-8f59-771f03a2bf41.jpg)
[![Senna • 2024 • Senna's story is compelling but this series failed to capture Fl racing in a realistic way. Don't recommend for anyone who actually knows Fl or the Senna story already. • Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.png)](/images/posts/SennaReview-5cd2edc2-d007-4dd7-b37a-b2719957697b.jpg)
[![Surviving Black Hawk Down • Everyone knows the Black Hawk Down story - here are some people who were there. A good documentary, with views from all sides. It was two terrible days that never should have happened. • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/SurvivingBlackHawkDownReview-a6d3b952-df30-4f46-b9d7-845e7b6a3fce.png)](/images/posts/SurvivingBlackHawkDownReview-a6d3b952-df30-4f46-b9d7-845e7b6a3fce.jpg)
[![Mr Inbetween • 2018 • Finished all 3 seasons, and apparently | *HAD* watched the whole thing. But it's good enough to watch again. And probably again. Great show! • Loved It!](../../assets/images/posts/MrInbetweenReview-7ee14a41-5583-4682-8738-833a6761ec40.png)](/images/posts/MrInbetweenReview-7ee14a41-5583-4682-8738-833a6761ec40.jpg)
[![Missing You • 2025 • Again, my pet peeve is - starts off brilliantly and then gets dumb, implausible, and hand-wavy. WHY CAN'T tv writers stop getting lazy halfway through shows? Rosalind Eleazar is always good though. • Didn't Like It](../../assets/images/posts/Missing-You-review-E3468A66-9C4D-482C-9570-41B5E4390803.png)](/images/posts/Missing-You-review-E3468A66-9C4D-482C-9570-41B5E4390803.jpg)
