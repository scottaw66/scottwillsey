### 2024-08-10

I took out the YouTube section on the [/now](/now) page because there's no good way (or any way, for that matter) to get YouTube watch history.

### 2024-06-22

A whole new redesign to clean it up, make it sleeker, and hopefully make it easier to read posts. Loses persistent side menu and reverts to header menu (icons only again!). Better colors, no gradients anywhere.

[![Redesigned Home Page](../../assets/images/posts/HomePageUpdate20240620-978203AA-FAED-428A-BCA2-2902F26640D6.png)](/images/posts/HomePageUpdate20240620-978203AA-FAED-428A-BCA2-2902F26640D6.jpg)

[![Redesigned Home Page Light Theme](../../assets/images/posts/HomePageUpdateLightTheme20240620-4C825BBF-63B1-4C16-B901-3126BFF0CC0D.png)](/images/posts/HomePageUpdateLightTheme20240620-4C825BBF-63B1-4C16-B901-3126BFF0CC0D.jpg)

### 2024-06-05

Fixed an awkward image link mistake that resulted in 404s on full-sized images

### 2024-05-27

New light theme and wider body on large viewports.

### 2024-05-26

Wildly overhauls dark theme.

### 2024-05-25

Removed Fathom analytics, not because they were bad, but just because I wanted to quit paying for them. Also fixed a really dumb image overflow issue.

### 2024-05-23

Converted the full-sized images that the optimized post images link to from png to jpeg. Shout out to [Tiffany White](https://www.tiffwhite.me) for noticing some slow-loading gigantic pngs!

### 2024-04-08

Updated home page so that link posts show a link in front of the title. The post title on the home page still links to the blog post page, and then the title on the blog post page itself links to the external site. Maybe this is confusing, I don't know.

I changed the light theme quite a bit and also revamped the [/uses](/uses) page completely.

The previous menu was an iteration of a long-used header menu and looked like this:
