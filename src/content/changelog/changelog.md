### 2025-12-28

Added auto-creation of link posts to my new blog post scripts, fixes link post indicator icons.

### 2025-12-26

Fixed footnotes (oops - broken since the big site update in November). Removed the concept of a "series" from the site. There are no organized series anymore.

### 2025-12-16

Another "technically not site code" addition is a script for pulling all my current YouTube subscriptions and updating the [YouTube section](/links/#youtube) of the [Links page](/links/). I love scripts that just rip stuff out of a page and dump in new stuff.

### 2025-11-25

Created a link pruner to cautiously prune links from [Links page](/links/). It's not auto-running yet but I will put it in as an automatic step somewhere.

### 2025-11-19

Fixed the logic for the Recent Updates page list. I broke it when I decided it was part of the home page and then part of the sidebar on all other pages.

### 2025-11-17

I changed EVERYTHING (almost). Complete Site UI refresh with new fonts, colors, and sidebar menu!

I took out the YouTube section on the [/now](/now) page because there's no good way (or any way, for that matter) to get YouTube watch history.

### 2024-06-22

A whole new redesign to clean it up, make it sleeker, and hopefully make it easier to read posts. Loses persistent side menu and reverts to header menu (icons only again!). Better colors, no gradients anywhere.

[![Redesigned Home Page](../../assets/images/posts/HomePageUpdate20240620-978203AA-FAED-428A-BCA2-2902F26640D6.png)](/images/posts/HomePageUpdate20240620-978203AA-FAED-428A-BCA2-2902F26640D6.jpg)

[![Redesigned Home Page Light Theme](../../assets/images/posts/HomePageUpdateLightTheme20240620-4C825BBF-63B1-4C16-B901-3126BFF0CC0D.png)](/images/posts/HomePageUpdateLightTheme20240620-4C825BBF-63B1-4C16-B901-3126BFF0CC0D.jpg)

### 2024-06-05

Fixed an awkward image link mistake that resulted in 404s on full-sized images

### 2024-05-27

New light theme and wider body on large viewports.

### 2024-05-26

Wildly overhauls dark theme.

### 2024-05-25

Removed Fathom analytics, not because they were bad, but just because I wanted to quit paying for them. Also fixed a really dumb image overflow issue.

### 2024-05-23

Converted the full-sized images that the optimized post images link to from png to jpeg. Shout out to [Tiffany White](https://www.tiffwhite.me) for noticing some slow-loading gigantic pngs!

### 2024-04-08

Updated home page so that link posts show a link in front of the title. The post title on the home page still links to the blog post page, and then the title on the blog post page itself links to the external site. Maybe this is confusing, I don't know.

### 2024-03-28

I changed the light theme quite a bit and also revamped the [/uses](/uses) page completely.

### 2024-03-04

Added and styled this site changelog. Added Articles Worth Reading and Newsletters sections to Links page.

Revamped the dark theme to make it nicer and easier on the eyes.

### 2024-01-06

Added the [/links](/links) page! Also added auto-timestamp generation for links page, now page, uses page, and pins page..

### 2024-01-05

Implemented [remarkjs/remark-toc: plugin to generate a table of contents (TOC)](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc) for auto-TOC generation in blog posts if desired.

Added a [/now](/now) page!

[![Site with persistent side menu](../../assets/images/posts/AboutMe20240619-0F4953B3-E481-40C1-8754-8B9BE3686F44.png)](/images/posts/AboutMe20240619-0F4953B3-E481-40C1-8754-8B9BE3686F44.jpg)

The previous menu was an iteration of a long-used header menu and looked like this:
