### 2024-04-08

Updated home page so that link posts show a link in front of the title. The title still links to the blog post page. The blog post page's link then links to the external site. Maybe this is confusing, I don't know.

### 2024-03-28

I changed the light theme quite a bit and also revamped the [/uses](/uses) page completely.

### 2024-03-04

Added and styled this site changelog
