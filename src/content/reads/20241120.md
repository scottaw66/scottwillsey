**[Get in—We’re Chasing a Waymo Into the Future | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-robotaxi-driverless-future/)**  

Get in, loser – we're going to the Waymo mall. I don't know about any of these self-driving pioneer companies, but I do know that replacing all the parents racing their kids to school in the morning with automation sounds exquisite to me.

**[The Joy of Pachinko's Opening Credits - Pachinko Theme Song](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a39538403/pachinko-opening-credits-theme-song/)**

I'm catching up on [Pachinko](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/pachinko/umc.cmc.17vf6g68dy89kk1l1nnb6min4) now that season 2 is out, and the opening song is super incongrous and yet wildly compelling. This is a fun look at why and how. By the way, the cast and the acting and the story are all incredible. Watch, if you haven't.

**[How to Get Started on Bluesky | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-started-on-bluesky/)**

The best option is to not be on any social media at all. The second best option is do not be on Facebook or Twitter. But Bluesky is ok – for now.

**[Donald Trump’s plans on immigration are coming into focus | CNN Politics](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/16/politics/donald-trump-immigration-plans/index.html)**

Sorry for the downer, but the words of a wise man who once said "*******, what an asshole" sure come to mind when thinking about Donald Trump. The amazing thing is how many other assholes he can round up to work with him at the drop of a hat. There are a lot of people in this country whose entire identities revolve around hating the existence of other people. Do you think it's too late to get Jake Paul (also a massive tool) to fight Stephen Miller next?

**[Going the Distance at the Tram Driver Olympics - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/europe/tramdriver-competition-frankfurt-tram.html?unlocked_article_code=1.aE4.nK_w.11ru0YohEua7)**

I guess tram drivers can be competitve too. I'd like to see this in Japan. Pretty sure the main contest would be how close to the second you can hit your arrival and departure schedules, and they'd all win.
