**[Taiwan Makes the Majority of the World’s Computer Chips. Now It’s Running Out of Electricity | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/)**

This story is kind of playing out all over the world whether it be power or water, whether it be about semiconductor manufacturing or data centers. This stuff takes resources, and we're kind of running out of them.

**[Ancient supermassive black hole is blowing galaxy-killing wind, James Webb Space Telescope finds | Space](https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-earliest-quasar-wind)**

This is wild. I always think of black holes as sucking everything in, and now they're blowing it all out. Kind of reminds me of [Spaceballs](https://www.quotes.net/mquote/89075).

**[A brief history of defragging – The Eclectic Light Company](https://eclecticlight.co/2024/10/05/a-brief-history-of-defragging/)**
