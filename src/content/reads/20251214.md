**[Travelers could face stricter screening including social media history](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/12/10/cbp-us-traveler-screening-social-media-history/87699331007/)**

Everyone's excited about the 5 years of social media, which isn't great at all, but no one's talking about the biometrics and DNA samples that CBP wants. I would not come here if I wasn't a citizen. Not worth it.

**[Researchers Uncover 30+ Flaws in AI Coding Tools Enabling Data Theft and RCE Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/researchers-uncover-30-flaws-in-ai.html?m=1)**

**[Why Honda is suddenly launching reusable rockets | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/832364/honda-reusable-rocket-space-exploration)**  

I would love to see somebody, ANYBODY, take on SpaceX, and why not Honda? I don't know if there's a company that I (rightly or wrongly) associate less with evil.
