**[Simon Laveuve’s 1/35-Scale Dwellings Hint at a Post-Apocalyptic Way of Life — Colossal](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/02/simon-laveuves-miniature-house-sculptures/)**  

Somehow apocalyptic renderings always seem less apocalyptic than you know they would be. If the worst I wind up in the end days is hiding out in a weird shack like one of these, I'm probably ok with it.  

**[20 jaw-dropping places on Earth that look like an alien planet | Space](https://www.space.com/the-universe/earth/20-jaw-dropping-places-on-earth-that-look-like-an-alien-planet)**  

It's easy to hate this place (earth) in recent times, but take a look around it a little more. Maybe you'll feel a tiny bit better about the planet we're burning. I particularly love Lake Hillier and The Giant's Causeway. The latter looks like the cover of Houses of the Holy.  

**[New matcha crepes in Nara serve up good luck with traditional Japanese patterns | SoraNews24 -Japan News-](https://soranews24.com/2025/01/31/new-matcha-crepes-in-nara-serve-up-good-luck-with-traditional-japanese-patterns/)**  

I've read quite a few things recently that make me slightly pessimistic about the future of Japan, but this isn't one of them. MATCHA CREPES! Even better, the shop that makes them, Mikuriya, is stuffed at the bottom of a staircase in Higashimuki Shopping Street that appears to be completely inaccessible. It's very Japanese.  

**[What do Egyptian mummies smell like? Surprisingly pleasant. | Popular Science](https://www.popsci.com/science/what-do-mummies-smell-like/)**  

Stopping sniffing those matcha crepes and get a whiff of these! I'm a little undecided as to whether mummies really smell as good as advertised or researchers just spend too much time in ancient university buildings. Either way, I think we've finally discovered something that has never been dusted with matcha powder.
