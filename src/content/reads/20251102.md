**[Ehon Mizu Ya Sora: A Forerunner of Modern Manga, 1780 - Flashbak](https://flashbak.com/ehon-mizu-ya-sora-479285/)**  

Long before Katsuhiro Otomo, there was Nichosai.  

**[Kia Delays EV4 Sedan 'Until Further Notice' In The U.S., Which Sucks For Fans Of Cool, Affordable Cars](https://www.jalopnik.com/2013405/kia-ev4-sedan-usa-launch-delay/)**  

The US is going to look really stupid in a few years for hating the "woke" EV agenda. Although truthfully, if it kills Tesla in the process, I couldn't be happier.

Humans constantly underestimate animals and constantly overestimate our own intellectual and biolgocial distance from them.  

**[The 16th-Century Artist Who Created the First Compendium of Insect Drawings — Colossal](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/07/joris-hoefnagel-insect-drawings/)**

Another entry in the "people in the past were smarter than we're going to be" department. I guess I won't claim that EVERYONE in the past was interested in their surroundings, but I bet it was more people percentage-wise than today.
