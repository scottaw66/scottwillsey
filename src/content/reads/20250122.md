**[Do You Believe in Life After Death? These Scientists Study It. - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/style/virginia-dops-reincarnation.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk4.IS27.AzO23nXoFSz4&smid=url-share)**  

I don't know how anyone would ever prove reincarnation, but it seems like a fun job trying. Better than digging ditches or trying to keep hackers out of your financial institution.

**[A brief history of logs and Console – The Eclectic Light Company](https://eclecticlight.co/2024/12/21/a-brief-history-of-logs-and-console/)**

If you're a Mac person who's ever dug through Console logs looking for errors, this should be a fun read. I've always appreciated the fact that the Mac tried to give a one-stop shopping center for logs.

**[A Capitol Rioter’s Son Is Terrified About His Father’s Release | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/capitol-riot-jan-6-pardon-family-threats-reffitt/)**  

Yikes. How'd you like to turn your father in for insurrection and then have the incoming fascist-in-chief pardon him? On top of that, this kid is gay and I can't imagine his Texas Three Percenter father being super chill about that. By the way, the dad that was pardoned is the one who threatened to crack Nancy Pelosi's head open on the Capitol steps. Thanks for voting Trump, America.

**[I’m a Luddite (and So Can You!) | The Nib](https://thenib.com/im-a-luddite/)**  

I'm not sure I'm full-Luddite, but considering the damage what passes for Silicon Valley is doing these days and how enthusiastically they've cozied up to corrupt and power abusing politicians, I think it's ok to be one. Also consider the huge environmental aspects of the mega-data center build-outs. It's a weird time to be in tech, I'll say that.

**[From Infocom to 80 Days: An oral history of text games and interactive fiction - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/from-infocom-to-80-days-an-oral-history-of-text-games-and-interactive-fiction/)**  

Stepping back to when tech was fun with very few qualifications, here's a great story. Am I the only one old enough to remember these? I know I'm not, so are you. Stop lying.
