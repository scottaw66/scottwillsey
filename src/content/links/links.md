Lots of gaming stuff here which is pretty cool.

Ronnie Lutes ‚Äì blogger, former podcaster, and fan of history.  

**[Marco.org](https://marco.org/)**  
You all know who Marco Arment is. I put this in blogrolls because he doesn't write often, and it's not *always* about Apple stuff. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  

**[Blog ‚Äì Mark writes](https://mdhughes.tech/blog/)**  
Retro computing and a lot more.  

**[Matt Stein](https://mattstein.com/)**  
I just found Matt's blog today when he answered Molly White's [call for blogs](https://hachyderm.io/@molly0xfff/111908294962007998). Looks interesting.  

**[Posts | Nathan's Site](https://nthp.me/posts/)**  
Mac, web, and probably some FOSS stuff.  

**[nico‚Äôs blog ¬∑ Why store your 2FA in your password manager](https://cropp.blog/)**  
I knew this was an omg.lol guy as soon as I saw the site. üòÑ I really like the design and readability here.

Web, Mac, and more.  

**[Miriam Eric Suzanne](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/)**

I just started reading this blog, but anything about web development is always of interest and use to me.

See the notes for EuroVan Camper Stuff above - it's David H!  

**[Philip Zastrow](https://zastrow.co/)**  
I love all the different websites from designers. This is super cool too.  

**[Pixel Envy](https://pxlnv.com/)**  
Nick Heer's blog. I just stumbled across this tonight myself. Very much tech related, like most of the blogs I list here.  

**[Home | Rach Smith's digital garden](https://rachsmith.com/)**  
The modern web is beautiful. Rach Smith's site is part of why.  

**[Rebecca Owen](https://beccais.online/)**  
I don't know Rebecca Owen, but I really like her site, and she's got a now page, so she must be ok. üòÑ  

**[Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/)**  
Robb Knight does beautiful web work. AND he's a nice human being! But what really makes him stand out is his amazing [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) page.  

**[Rosemary Orchard](https://rosemaryorchard.com/)**  
If you're into Apple platforms and automation, you've definitely heard of Rosemary Orchard. A tech wizard and creator of good ideas.

What an amazing programming explainer blog! Sam has all kinds of interactive visualizations for clarifying programming concepts, and it's delightful.  

**[Sarah Rainsberger üê¶](<https://www.rainsberger.ca/>)**  
Sarah Rainsberger is lead for the [Astro docs project](https://docs.astro.build/), and she's also a super nice, super helpful, and super capable and organized human being. I sure hope the Astro people know how valuable she is to their mission.  

**[SIRACUSA SAYS](https://siracusasays.com/)**  
A fun collection of things John Siracusa has said on podcasts.  

**[Silvia Maggi - Designer](https://silviamaggidesign.com/)**  
I only just found Silvia Maggi's site, but as anyone can see by my site, I need all the help I can get with accessibility and usability, so her site looks like a great resource.  

**[Stephanie Eckles ‚Äì Front-End SWE, Author, Speaker](<https://thinkdobecreate.com/>)**  
Stephanie Eckles is kind of amazing. She does a **ton** for CSS, web development, and positive encouragement and inclusivity through her writing and her videos. I think she's pretty well known and respected in the CSS world.  

**[...tiff is typing](https://www.tiffwhite.me/)**  
Tiffany White writes, does web development, has a cat, and is clearly a good person, but more than that, she's someone I can become a better person by listening to and learning from.  

**[unixsheikh.com](https://unixsheikh.com/)**  
Unix, linux, open source.  

**[Vic Hudson](https://vichudson1.com/)**  
I'm really just putting this here to put pressure on Vic to modernize his site and start blogging about his gourmet adventures.  

**[Waxy.org - Andy Baio lives here](https://waxy.org/)**  
I think a lot of people know of Andy Baio, but I'll admit I wasn't reading his blog until recently.  

**[Wild Thoughts](https://sarafen.com/wildthoughts/)**  
This is another one where the design immediately hooked me. Sara's site has it in spades. Beautiful!
