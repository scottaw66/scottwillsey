Bryce Wray writes articles that help me figure out solutions to web development related problems I have, and for that reason alone, I love and recommend him.  

**[Byte Cellar - The Vintage Computing Weblog](https://bytecellar.com/)**
The most interesting man in the world isn't that old guy with the beard and the gravelly voice in the beer commercials. It's Blake Patterson. The Byte Cellar is an internet-ional treasure of nostalgia and experimentation.

**[Carlo Zottmann](https://zottmann.org/)**  
Carlo posts links! And who doesn't love links??  

**[Cassidy's blog](https://blog.cassidoo.co/)**  
Cassidy Williams does great work in the web world. She's a great web advocate.

Habib Cham is one of the nicest people you'll meet on the socials, and he's always got thoughts about tech, sports, and life. The world needs more people like him.  

**[CodeMacLife](https://codemaclife.com/)**  
I don't really know much about Mark except that I stumbled across his blog and found it interesting. The title should tell you he's into the Apple ecosphere.  

**[Cole's Blog](https://coleb.blog/)**  
I like people who blog because they love to, results be damned!  

**[Colin Devroe - Photographer. Blogger. Reverse Engineer.](https://cdevroe.com/)**

Software developer and personal blogger.

**[David Amador](https://www.david-amador.com/)**  
Lots of gaming stuff here which is pretty cool.  

**[davidnelson.net](https://davidnelson.net/)**  
David Nelson. What a nice man. I enjoy his thoughts on life in general. He's in the Apple world, but he's also a nice, level-headed adult who I greatly enjoy talking with.  

**[The Dent ·](https://acn.lol/)**  
Did I ever tell you that Andy Nicolaides was a co-host of mine on Pocket Sized Podcast for a time? He was, but don't hold that against him - go read what he says about tech!  

**[The Eclectic Light Company – Macs, painting, and more](https://eclecticlight.co/)**  
I don't know about the paintings because I haven't looked that far yet, but the Mac stuff is stupendously great. Howard Oakley should be proud (but not too proud, because no one likes arrogance).

**[ericportis.com](https://ericportis.com/)**  
I came for the colorspace article, I stayed for the photography. Wow!  

**[EuroVan Camper Stuff](https://1705.net/)**  
I don't think I know David H's last name, but he's the same guy from Notes and Ramblings below. He's also a Hemispheric Views adjacent person, and I like him.  

**[Flashing Palely in the Margins](https://www.inthemargins.ca/)**  
Sameer's design is so clean and so fresh, you'll have to read this blog.  

**[Gordon's Tech](https://tech.kateva.org/)**  
Gordon's Tech is tech related, and it's by John Gordon! Didn't see that coming, did ya?!  

**[Harshil Shah](https://harshil.net/)**  
I like Harshil Shah. I think everyone likes Harshil Shah. He created the excellent [Peak](https://sneakpeak.app) and [Pause](https://harshil.net/pause) apps, and more importantly, he brings light to the world.  

**[Heavy Home](https://heavy.rocks/)**  
It's 1999, and even if it's not, Mike is going to pretend like it is!  

**[Hello! from Rick Cogley](https://cogley.jp/)**  
Rick's microblog on tech and Japan! Hey, I like both of those things!  

**[Home | James' Coffee Blog](https://jamesg.blog/)**  
Is it a blog? Is it a coffee blog? I guess it's both, because James says so. Either way, it's also about the indieweb, and I'm here for it!  

**[Jascha’s blog | This blog is intended to be a place to share ideas and results that are too weird, incomplete, or off-topic to turn into an academic paper, but that I think may be important. Let me know what you think! Contact links to the left.](https://sohl-dickstein.github.io/)**  
This is some crazy brain food that I probably won't understand most of.  

**[Hey, it's Jason! // Welcome!](https://grepjason.sh/)**  
Jason is a [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com) guy, a Portlander, *and* he's got a really, really nice looking website.  

**[Hugo's Blog](https://hugo.blog/)**  
Hugo is apparently a Meta Quest guy and he just wrote an encyclopedia-sized article on the Apple Vision Pro. I hope not every blog post he does is that long, but it's a fascinating read anyway.

**[Hypercritical](https://hypercritical.co/)**  
I mean, it's John Siracusa.  

**[I Build Things — Chris McLeod](https://chrismcleod.dev/)**  
I love the design of this site. Wow!  

**[Blog | Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/)**  
Another example of a blog that's well worth reading already, but then also has this design it's fantastic.

**[kottke.org - home of fine hypertext products](https://kottke.org/)**  
I don't need to tell you about kottke.org. **NO ONE** needs to tell you about kottke.org!!!  

**[Home | LewisDale.dev](https://lewisdale.dev/)**  
His post on Perpelexity AI being subject to prompt injection is pretty good.  

**[The Liner Project](https://thelinerproject.com/)**  
Ronnie Lutes – friend, blogger, former podcaster, and fan of history. Also I think he knows all the best restaurants in Vegas, so you should probably ask him questions if you're headed there.

**[Blog | LMNT](https://lmnt.me/blog/)**  
Louie Mantia's blog. Lots of interesting ideas here, and the rest of the sight is great too. It's even a Cool Site Spotlight entry.

**[Marco.org](https://marco.org/)**  
You all know who Marco Arment is. I put this in blogrolls because he doesn't write often, and it's not *always* about Apple stuff. 🤷‍♂️  

**[Blog – Mark writes](https://mdhughes.tech/blog/)**  
Retro computing and a lot more.  

**[Martin Gunnarsson](https://www.martingunnarsson.com/)**  
Martin writes a lot about bikes, and a lot about Eleventy.  

**[Matt Stein](https://mattstein.com/)**  
I just found Matt's blog today when he answered Molly White's [call for blogs](https://hachyderm.io/@molly0xfff/111908294962007998). Looks interesting.  

**[mb bischoff](https://mbbischoff.com/)**  
Designer, developer, blogger, Lickability. It's all good stuff.  

**[Miriam Eric Suzanne](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/)**  
Miriam Eric Suzanne writes about the web and CSS. I can't remember where I first saw Miriam speaking, but it was either in the context of the W3C CSS working group or SASS.  

**[meyerweb.com](https://meyerweb.com/)**  
Another site with unique and beautiful design. And it's all about web-related topics, so you'll love that too.  

**[Blog – Nathan Knowler](https://knowler.dev/blog)**  
I just started reading this blog, but anything about web development is always of interest and use to me.  

**[Posts | Nathan's Site](https://nthp.me/posts/)**  
Mac, web, and probably some FOSS stuff.  

**[net.wars - computers, freedom, and privacy](https://netwars.pelicancrossing.net/)**  
Wendy Grossman writes about computers, freedom, and privacy.  

**[nico’s blog · Why store your 2FA in your password manager](https://cropp.blog/)**  
I knew this was an omg.lol guy as soon as I saw the site. 😄 I really like the design and readability here.  

**[Notes · Matthias Ott – User Experience Designer](https://matthiasott.com/notes)**  
Web, Mac, and more.  

**[Notes and Ramblings](https://notes.1705.net/)**  
See the notes for EuroVan Camper Stuff above - it's David H!  

**[Philip Zastrow](https://zastrow.co/)**  
I love all the different websites from designers. This is super cool too.  

**[Phil's weblog](https://stollerys.co.uk/)**  
Some of my favorite blogs are the ones that are all about how the website is built. I love that stuff.  

**[Pixel Envy](https://pxlnv.com/)**  
Nick Heer's blog. I just stumbled across this tonight myself. Very much tech related, like most of the blogs I list here.  

**[Home | Rach Smith's digital garden](https://rachsmith.com/)**  
The modern web is beautiful. Rach Smith's site is part of why.  

**[Realmac Dan - Realmac Dan](https://realmacdan.com/)**  
What? Realmac Dan? **THE** [Realmac](https://www.realmacsoftware.com)?  

**[Rebecca Owen](https://beccais.online/)**  
I don't know Rebecca Owen, but I really like her site, and she's got a now page, so she must be ok. 😄  

**[Riccardo Mori | Writer & Translator](https://morrick.me/)**  
Riccardo seems like a very serious blogger, and I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean he seems to consider his words carefully, and that's probably something I should do more of.  

**[Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/)**  
Robb Knight does beautiful web work. AND he's a nice human being! But what really makes him stand out is his amazing [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) page.  

**[Rosemary Orchard](https://rosemaryorchard.com/)**  
If you're into Apple platforms and automation, you've definitely heard of Rosemary Orchard. A tech wizard and creator of good ideas.  

**[samwho](https://samwho.dev/)**
What an amazing programming explainer blog! Sam has all kinds of interactive visualizations for clarifying programming concepts, and it's delightful.  

**[Sarah Rainsberger 🐦](<https://www.rainsberger.ca/>)**  
Sarah Rainsberger is lead for the [Astro docs project](https://docs.astro.build/), and she's also a super nice, super helpful, and super capable and organized human being. I sure hope the Astro people know how valuable she is to their mission.  

**[Shankar UX](https://shankarux.com/)**  
Shankar designs Gmail interactions. He's also recently discovered the modern personal web, which I think is bigger than he realizes. I hope he makes the most of it.  

**[SIRACUSA SAYS](https://siracusasays.com/)**  
A fun collection of things John Siracusa has said on podcasts.  

**[Silvia Maggi - Designer](https://silviamaggidesign.com/)**  
I only just found Silvia Maggi's site, but as anyone can see by my site, I need all the help I can get with accessibility and usability, so her site looks like a great resource.  

**[Stephanie Eckles – Front-End SWE, Author, Speaker](<https://thinkdobecreate.com/>)**  
Stephanie Eckles is kind of amazing. She does a **ton** for CSS, web development, and positive encouragement and inclusivity through her writing and her videos. I think she's pretty well known and respected in the CSS world.  

**[Taggart Tech](https://taggart-tech.com/)**  
A tech blog with a delightfully retro design.  

**[TechDistortion](https://techdistortion.com/)**  
John Chidgey is an engineer first and foremost, and a podcaster and writer additionally. That's not to downplay those works – they're excellent. It's just to emphasize how based in analysis his work is.

**[...tiff is typing](https://www.tiffwhite.me/)**  
Tiffany White writes, does web development, has a cat, and is clearly a good person, but more than that, she's someone I can become a better person by listening to and learning from.  

**[unixsheikh.com](https://unixsheikh.com/)**  
Unix, linux, open source.  

**[Waxy.org - Andy Baio lives here](https://waxy.org/)**  
I think a lot of people know of Andy Baio, but I'll admit I wasn't reading his blog until recently.  

**[Wild Thoughts](https://sarafen.com/wildthoughts/)**  
This is another one where the design immediately hooked me. Sara's site has it in spades. Beautiful!

**[Ye Olde Blogroll - Blogroll.org](https://blogroll.org/)**  
It's not a blog, it's not a roll, it's a BLOGROLL!!!  

**[You have arrived at a website named heydonworks.com: HeydonWorks](https://heydonworks.com/)**  
The blog is currently a lot about web programming, but there's all kinds of other stuff on this site too, and I really love the unique design.  

**[Your Intermittent Lex](https://lexfriedman.com/newsletter/)**  
Lex Friedman, creator of many things including [Lex's Games by Lex Friedman](https://lex.games/)!  

**[四畳半のへや](https://blog.moeyua.com/)**  
The title of this blog means four and a half tatami mats, which is a small room size in Japan. The site is bilingual, so if you're like me and you can read some Japanese very slowly, you'll love this site based on the topics AND the experience. Oh, and it looks beautiful.
