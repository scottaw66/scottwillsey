| [Birchtree](https://birchtree.me/) | Matt Birchler is a UI and UX designer and YouTuber, but he's also a man of interesting thoughts on tech topics. |
| [Rosemary Orchard](<https://rosemaryorchard.com/>) | If you're into Apple platforms and automation, you've definitely heard of Rosemary Orchard. A tech wizard and creator of good ideas. |

| [Chamline](https://www.chamline.net/) | Habib Cham is one of the nicest people you'll meet on the socials, and he's always got thoughts about tech, sports, and life. The world needs more people like him. |
| [CodeMacLife](https://codemaclife.com/) | I don't really know much about Mark except that I stumbled across his blog and found it interesting. The title should tell you he's into the Apple ecosphere. |
| [Craig Mod ‚Äî Writer + Photographer](https://craigmod.com/) | Craig Mod is a writer and photographer and *really* thoughtful guy. The fact that he lives in and walks all over Japan, where I lived as a boy, makes him even more interesting to me. |
| [davidnelson.net](https://davidnelson.net/) | David Nelson. What a kind man. I enjoy his thoughts on life in general. He's in the Apple world, but he's also a nice, level-headed, mature adult. üòÑ |
| [The Dent ¬∑](https://acn.lol/) | Did I ever tell you that Andy Nicolaides was a co-host of mine on Pocket Sized Podcast for a time? He was, but don't hold that against him - go read what he says about tech! |
| [EuroVan Camper Stuff](https://1705.net/) | I don't think I know David H's last name, but he's the same guy from Notes and Ramblings below. He's also a Hemispheric Views adjacent person, and I like him. |

| [Harshil Shah](https://harshil.net/) | I like Harshil Shah. I think everyone likes Harshil Shah. He created the excellent [Peak](https://sneakpeak.app) and [Pause](https://harshil.net/pause) apps, and more importantly, he brings light to the world. |
| [Hey, it's Jason! // Welcome!](https://grepjason.sh/) | Jason is a [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com) guy, a Portlander, *and* he's got a really, really nice looking website. |
| [kottke.org - home of fine hypertext products](https://kottke.org/) | I don't need to tell you about kottke.org. **NO ONE** needs to tell you about kottke.org!!! |
| [The Liner Project](https://thelinerproject.com/) | Ronnie Lutes ‚Äì friend, blogger, former podcaster... what isn't he? He's no jerk, that's for sure! One day I'm moving to Vegas, Ronnie, and I'm moving into your house! |
| [Marco.org](https://marco.org/) | You all know who Marco Arment is. I put this in blogrolls because he doesn't write often, and it's not *always* about Apple stuff. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è |
| [Notes and Ramblings](https://notes.1705.net/) | See the notes for EuroVan Camper Stuff above - it's David H! |
| [Rebecca Owen](https://beccais.online/) | I don't know Rebecca Owen, but I really like her site, and she's got a now page, so she must be ok. üòÑ |
| [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/) | Robb Knight does beautiful web work. AND he's a nice human being! But what really makes him stand out is his amazing [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) page. |
| [Sarah Rainsberger üê¶](<https://www.rainsberger.ca/>) | Sarah Rainsberger is lead for the [Astro docs project](https://docs.astro.build/), and she's also a super nice, super helpful, and super capable and organized human being. I sure hope the Astro people know how valuable she is to their mission. |
| [Silvia Maggi - Designer](https://silviamaggidesign.com/) | I only just found Silvia Maggi's site, but as anyone can see by my site, I need all the help I can get with accessibility and usability, so her site looks like a great resource. |
| [Stephanie Eckles ‚Äì Front-End SWE, Author, Speaker](<https://thinkdobecreate.com/>) | Stephanie Eckles is kind of amazing. She does a **ton** for CSS, web development, and positive encouragement and inclusivity through her writing and her videos. I think she's pretty well known and respected in the CSS world. |
