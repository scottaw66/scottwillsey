**[The Eclectic Light Company ‚Äì Macs, painting, and more](https://eclecticlight.co/)**  
I don't know about the paintings because I haven't looked that far yet, but the Mac stuff is stupendously great. Howard Oakley should be proud (but not too proud, because no one likes arrogance).

Jason is a [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com) guy, a Portlander, *and* he's got a really, really nice looking website.  

**[Hugo's Blog](https://hugo.blog/)**

I mean, it's John Siracusa.

His post on Perpelexity AI being subject to prompt injection is pretty good.  

**[The Liner Project](https://thelinerproject.com/)**  
Ronnie Lutes ‚Äì friend, blogger, former podcaster, and fan of history. Also I think he knows all the best restaurants in Vegas, so you should probably ask him questions if you're headed there.

**[Blog | LMNT](https://lmnt.me/blog/)**  
Louie Mantia's blog. Lots of interesting ideas here, and the rest of the sight is great too. It's even a Cool Site Spotlight entry.

**[Marco.org](https://marco.org/)**  
You all know who Marco Arment is. I put this in blogrolls because he doesn't write often, and it's not *always* about Apple stuff. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The modern web is beautiful. Rach Smith's site is part of why.  

**[Realmac Dan - Realmac Dan](https://realmacdan.com/)**  
What? Realmac Dan? **THE** [Realmac](https://www.realmacsoftware.com)?  

**[Rebecca Owen](https://beccais.online/)**  
I don't know Rebecca Owen, but I really like her site, and she's got a now page, so she must be ok. üòÑ  

**[Riccardo Mori | Writer & Translator](https://morrick.me/)**  
Riccardo seems like a very serious blogger, and I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean he seems to consider his words carefully, and that's probably something I should do more of.  

**[Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/)**  
Robb Knight does beautiful web work. AND he's a nice human being! But what really makes him stand out is his amazing [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) page.  

**[Rosemary Orchard](https://rosemaryorchard.com/)**  
If you're into Apple platforms and automation, you've definitely heard of Rosemary Orchard. A tech wizard and creator of good ideas.  

**[samwho](https://samwho.dev/)**
What an amazing programming explainer blog! Sam has all kinds of interactive visualizations for clarifying programming concepts, and it's delightful.  

**[Sarah Rainsberger üê¶](<https://www.rainsberger.ca/>)**  
Sarah Rainsberger is lead for the [Astro docs project](https://docs.astro.build/), and she's also a super nice, super helpful, and super capable and organized human being. I sure hope the Astro people know how valuable she is to their mission.  

**[Shankar UX](https://shankarux.com/)**  
Shankar designs Gmail interactions. He's also recently discovered the modern personal web, which I think is bigger than he realizes. I hope he makes the most of it.  

**[SIRACUSA SAYS](https://siracusasays.com/)**  
A fun collection of things John Siracusa has said on podcasts.  

**[Silvia Maggi - Designer](https://silviamaggidesign.com/)**  
I only just found Silvia Maggi's site, but as anyone can see by my site, I need all the help I can get with accessibility and usability, so her site looks like a great resource.  

**[Stephanie Eckles ‚Äì Front-End SWE, Author, Speaker](<https://thinkdobecreate.com/>)**  
Stephanie Eckles is kind of amazing. She does a **ton** for CSS, web development, and positive encouragement and inclusivity through her writing and her videos. I think she's pretty well known and respected in the CSS world.  

**[Taggart Tech](https://taggart-tech.com/)**  
A tech blog with a delightfully retro design.  

**[TechDistortion](https://techdistortion.com/)**  
John Chidgey is an engineer first and foremost, and a podcaster and writer additionally. That's not to downplay those works ‚Äì they're excellent. It's just to emphasize how based in analysis his work is.

**[...tiff is typing](https://www.tiffwhite.me/)**  
Tiffany White writes, does web development, has a cat, and is clearly a good person, but more than that, she's someone I can become a better person by listening to and learning from.  

**[unixsheikh.com](https://unixsheikh.com/)**  
Unix, linux, open source.  

**[Waxy.org - Andy Baio lives here](https://waxy.org/)**  
I think a lot of people know of Andy Baio, but I'll admit I wasn't reading his blog until recently.  

**[Wild Thoughts](https://sarafen.com/wildthoughts/)**  
This is another one where the design immediately hooked me. Sara's site has it in spades. Beautiful!

**[Ye Olde Blogroll - Blogroll.org](https://blogroll.org/)**  
It's not a blog, it's not a roll, it's a BLOGROLL!!!  

**[You have arrived at a website named heydonworks.com: HeydonWorks](https://heydonworks.com/)**  
The blog is currently a lot about web programming, but there's all kinds of other stuff on this site too, and I really love the unique design.  

**[Your Intermittent Lex](https://lexfriedman.com/newsletter/)**  
Lex Friedman, creator of many things including [Lex's Games by Lex Friedman](https://lex.games/)!  

**[ÂõõÁï≥Âçä„ÅÆ„Å∏„ÇÑ](https://blog.moeyua.com/)**  
The title of this blog means four and a half tatami mats, which is a small room size in Japan. The site is bilingual, so if you're like me and you can read some Japanese very slowly, you'll love this site based on the topics AND the experience. Oh, and it looks beautiful.
